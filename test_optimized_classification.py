    Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as:
    2x + 3y = 15
    x - y = 2
    
    To solve this system, we can use substitution. From the second equation: x = y + 2
    Substituting into the first: 2(y + 2) + 3y = 15
    2y + 4 + 3y = 15
    5y = 11

    Here's how to implement a binary search algorithm in Python:
    
    ```python
    def binary_search(arr, target):
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            if arr[mid] == target:
                return mid

                left = mid + 1

                right = mid - 1
                
        return -1
    ```
    
    The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

    Machine learning is a methodology that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
    According to research, supervised learning algorithms require labeled training data.
    The framework of deep neural networks consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes.
    
    Key principles of artificial intelligence include:
    1. Pattern recognition and classification
    2. Decision-making under uncertainty  
    3. Natural language processing capabilities
    4. Computer vision and image analysis
    
    The concept of backpropagation is fundamental to training neural networks.
    Studies indicate that ensemble methods often outperform individual models.
    The theoretical foundation of machine learning draws from statistics, optimization, and probability theory.
    
    Research shows that feature engineering significantly impacts model performance.
    The approach of transfer learning leverages pre-trained models for new tasks.
    According to recent studies, attention mechanisms have revolutionized natural language processing.
