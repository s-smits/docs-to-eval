  "Aita (mythology)": "Aita(Etruscan:𐌀𐌕𐌉𐌀), also spelledEita(Etruscan:𐌀𐌕𐌉𐌄), is an epithet of theEtruscanchthonicfire godŚurias god of theunderworld, roughlyequivalentto theGreekgodHades(Epic Greek:Ἄϊδης,romanized:Áïdēs).\n\nAita is a relatively late addition to the Etruscanpantheon, appearing in iconography and in Etruscan text beginning in the 4th century BC, and is heavily influenced by his Greek counterpart, Hades.Aita is pictured in only a few instances in Etruscan tomb painting, such as in theGolini TombfromOrvietoand the tomb ofOrcus IIfromTarquinia.In these tomb paintings, he is shown with his consortPersipnei(Etruscan:𐌉𐌄𐌍𐌐𐌉𐌔𐌛𐌄𐌐), also spelledPhersipnai(Etruscan:𐌉𐌀𐌍𐌐𐌉𐌔𐌛𐌄𐌘), the Etruscan equivalent to the GreekPersephone.\n\nAlthough Aita is very rarely depicted, he may appear enthroned and sometimes wears a wolf cap, borrowing a key attribute from the earlier Etruscan underworld wolf-deity, namedCalu.Other examples of Aita in Etruscan art depict hisabduction of Persipnei. Aside from tomb painting, Aita may be identified in a few examples in othermedia, including on a 4th-century painted vase fromVulci, two 2nd century alabaster ash urns fromVolterra, and a Red Figure 4th–3rd centuryOinochoe.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n\nDe Grummond, Nancy Thomson(2004).\"For the Mother and for the Daughter: Some Thoughts on Dedications from Etruria and Praeneste\".Hesperia Supplements.33.

  "Catha (mythology)": "Catha(Etruscan:𐌀𐌈𐌀𐌂,romanized:Catha, also written𐌈𐌀𐌂,Cath,𐌀𐌈𐌖𐌀𐌂,Cautha, or𐌀𐌈𐌅𐌀𐌊,Kavtha) is a femaleEtruscanlunar or solar deity, who may also be connected to childbirth, and has a connection to the underworld.Catha is also the goddess of the south sanctuary atPyrgi, Italy.\n\nShe is known asLeucotheain ancient Greek. She is often seen with the Etruscan godŚuriwith whom she shares a cult.Catha is also frequently paired with the Etruscan godFufluns, who is the counterpart to the Greek godDionysus, and Pacha, the counterpart to the Roman god Bacchus.Additionally, at Pyrgi, Catha is linked with the god Aplu, the counterpart to the Greek godApollo.Aplu may have even taken some of the characteristics of Catha when he was brought into theEtruscan religion.Giovanni Colonnahas suggested that Catha is linked to the GreekPersephonesince he links Catha's consort,Śuri, toDis Paterin Roman mythology.\n\nInscriptions\n\n\n## Inscriptions\n\n\nThe bulk of information regarding Catha comes mostly from inscriptions on Etruscan artifacts. One example that shows the importance of Catha at Pyrgi is the discovery of gold earrings dating from 530 to 520 BCE which were dedicated to Catha.The Sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas from the third century BCE fromTarquiniahas an epitaph stating that the deceased individual was a priest of Catha amongst many other titles.Catha is named on thePiacenza Liveron the right lobe where the gods of the lights and heavens are listed.This suggests that Catha was a cult deity. On some inscriptions, Catha is simply referred to as \"daughter\", and in Martianus Capella she is referred to as \"the Daughter of the Sun\".She has also been called the \"Eye of the Sun\".This evidence, along with her placement on the Piacenza Liver over Usil, suggests that she may be the counterpart to the Roman Solis Filia; however Solis Filia does not have the underworld connection that Catha does.Catha's underworld connections can be best seen on an Attic skyphos from a necropolis in San Cerbone dating to the 5th century BCE with an inscription stating it is dedicated to Catha.\n\nCautha-sis also the first deity mentioned in theLead Plaque of Magliano, the full first line reading:\n\nFor Cautha, the annually appointed village priest will dedicate 80ez.In addition, dedications must be made in the place of offering, at the stream Casthia, where it empties into the lake, during Hev- period annually. And a dedication must be made in the sacred alcove that is the memorial for the deceased of the Murina family.\"\n\nAlthough there are no known labeled images of Catha,Nancy de Grummondhas argued that there are a number of depictions of Catha in art. She has stated that there are several kraters that show a deity that could be identified as Catha.One example that she cites is a krater fromAscianofrom 350-300 BCE that shows a deity beside two horses instead of four; a sign that they are there to take the dead to the afterlife, and this coupled with the other imagery on the krater suggests that this has an underworld aspect which Catha is associated with.Another potential image of Catha is a figure on an antefix on the twenty-celled building on Pyrgi who is again depicted with two horses.This claim is supported by the fact that this antefix is paired with another antefix that depicts a solar divinity who is likelyŚuri, the consort of Catha.A terracotta head discovered at Pyrgi from the fourth century BCE could also potentially a representation of Catha since she was a highly important goddess in the city.\n\nNancy de Grummondhas also argued that Catha could be a lunar divinity as opposed to a solar divinity. She points out that just because Catha is called the \"Daughter of the Sun\" does not necessarily mean that she is a solar goddess becauseSelene, the moon goddess in Greek mythology, is sometimes referred to as the daughter of the Sun as well.Some kraters that potentially illustrate Catha show the deity as having an ambiguous gender which is consistent with Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythologies.Lunaand Selene of Roman and Greek mythology, respectively, are shown driving two-horse chariots often in art.De Grummond has also suggested that sinceŚuriis a solar god and his consort is Catha, it would make logical sense for his partner to be lunar as opposed to another solar divinity.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n\nDe Grummond, Nancy Thomson(2004).\"For the Mother and for the Daughter: Some Thoughts on Dedications from Etruria and Praeneste\".Hesperia Supplements.33.

  "Cel (goddess)": "Celwas theEtruscan goddessof theearth. On the Etruscan calendar, the month ofCeli(September) is likely named for her.HerGreek counterpartisGaiaand herRomanisTellus.\n\nInEtruscan mythology, Cel was the mother of theGiants. Abronze mirrorfrom the 5th century BC depicts atheomachyin which Celsclan, \"son of Cel,\" is a Giant attacked byLaran, the god of war. In Greek, \"giant\" comes from a word meaning \"born from Gaia\".Another mirror depictsanguipedGiants in the company of a goddess, possibly Cel, whose lower body is formed ofvegetation.\n\nIn a sanctuary nearLake Trasimenowere found fivevotivebronze statuettes, some male and some female, dedicated to her asCel Ati, \"Mother Cel\".  The inscription on each readsmi celś atial celthi,\"I [belong to, have been given] to Cel the mother, here [in this sanctuary].\"\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n",
  "Charun": "InEtruscan mythology,Charun(also spelledCharu, orKarun) acted as one of thepsychopompoiof theunderworld(not to be confused with the god of the underworld, known to the Etruscans asAita). He is often portrayed withVanth, a winged figure also associated with the underworld.\n\nHis name was imported fromGreekCharon,although it is uncertain whether Etruscans had a native name for a god of the underworld before this. As suggested by alternations in theEtruscan languagesuch asθu\"one\" changing toθunśna\"first\",lev\"lion\" (fromGreekleōn)  andApulu(fromGreekApóllōn), words ending in-nafteruwere disappearing from the language which is why we see his name spelledXarunand laterXaru.\n\nAppearance\n\n\n## Appearance\n\n\nThe Etruscan Charun was fundamentally different from his Greek counterpart. Guarding the entry to the underworld, he is depicted with ahammer(his religious symbol) and is shown with pointed ears, snakes around his arms, and a blueish coloration symbolizing the decay of death. In some images, he has enormous wings. He is also depicted as a large creature withsnake-like hair,avulture's hookednose, largetuskslike aboar,heavy brow ridges,largelips, fiery eyes,pointedearsa blackbeard, enormouswings,discolored (pale cream, bluish or greyish)skin, and snakes around his arm.\n\nLarissa Bonfanteand Judith Swaddling have this to say about Charun:  \"Many scenes feature the two purely Etruscan underworld demons, Vanth and Charu, whose job is not to punish the dead but rather to escort them to their final destination.\"However, there are at least two examples, on the sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas as well as a red figure stamnos from Orbetello, that do illustrate Charun in a menacing fashion.Each depicts Charun threatening a male figure with his hammer.\n\nThe grotesque nature of the depiction of Charun appears to have been at least partlyapotropaicin nature. Apotropaic art was the practice of the neighboring Greeks at this time, as represented by the exaggerated eyes painted on drinking vessels in the 6th century BC to ward away spirits while drinking or the monstrous depiction ofMedusawhose image was said to turn men to stone. Through these images of the grotesque, violence, and blood-letting, the Etruscans may have believed that they helped to fend off evil spirits from the tomb as well as sanctify the tomb perhaps in place of the actual ritual sacrifice of an animal usually performed in funerary rites.\n\nNancy de Grummond offers a different view. The relief on the sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas atTarquinia, shows two Charuns swinging their hammers at a person's head, though the head (probably that of Pulenas, the nobleman whose sarcophagus it is) no longer survives in the relief due to an accident of preservation. Years later, in theColosseum, a Charun-like figure calledDispaterwould hit the loser with a hammer to make sure he was dead, perhaps in reflection of Charun.The hammer might also be used to protect the dead; it is sometimes swung at serpents attacking the deceased (as shown on the Orvieto amphora). Most often it is simply held, or the handle planted on the ground and the mallet head leaned upon(above).De Grummond notes that the ferry of Charon appears only once in surviving Etruscan art, and that some Etruscan demons are equipped with oars, but they typically use them as weapons rather than in their maritime function.\n\nModern views\n\n\n## Modern views\n\n\nMany authors tend to take a more sensationalist view of Charun, speaking of him as a \"death-demon\". Such authors may be inspired by Christian views ofHelland moral punishment. For the Etruscans, as with the Greeks, Hades was merely a morally neutral place of the dead. Neither the \"good\" nor the \"bad\" could escape the clutches of death, and both were assembled there together.\n\nRon Terpening, a professor of Italian literature at theUniversity of Arizona, cites Franz de Ruyt, who claims Charun is similar toChaldeandemons or theHindudivinitiesShivaandKali.He is presumed to be the servant ofMantusandMania, and, like Charon, is comparable to the Greeks'Thanatos, theErinyes, and theKeres.The author, like de Grummond, feels that some laterRenaissancepaintings of GreekCharonmay show the continuity of pre-Christian Etruscan beliefs.Later on when the deity had evolved into the GreekCharon,orCarontein Italian,Terpening notes that Charun's hammer ormalletis sometimes replaced with anoar, although it does not fit with his duties.\n\nAccording to Jeff Rovin[who?], Charun guided souls on horseback to the underworld and \"brings horses to the newly-dead\". He also claims that Charun appears to love violence and participates in warfare adding that Charun enjoys natural disasters as well.An Etruscankraterfrom François Tomb(above)depicts Charun withAjaxorAchilles(left, cropped out)slaughteringTrojanprisoners.  This urn is currently held inCabinet des Médailles920,Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris. Rovin says that some accounts depict him with asword, and that he \"slices\" souls with it. At least one image shows him guiding a soul on horseback, equipped with both a hammer and a sword, though he is simply carrying it on his person.\n\nThe Charon ofVergilin theAeneidis particularly cruel; according to W.F. Jackson Knight,\"Vergil's Charon is not only the Greek ferryman ofAristophanes[inThe Frogs], but more than half his Etruscan self, Charun, the Etruscan torturing death-devil, no ferryman at all.\"\n\nAssistants\n\n\n## Assistants\n\n\nCharun is believed to have worked with many assistants in the Underworld, although they could be independent deities in their own right.  Most of their names are lost to us, but at least one,Tuchulcha, is identified in theTomb of Orcus II, and has hair and wings like aGorgon.  Tuchulcha, whose gender is debated among scholars, appears in a depiction of the story ofTheseus(known to the Etruscans as \"These\") visiting the underworld. These and his friendPeirithousare playing aboard game, attended by Tuchulcha.\n\nThere are four Charuns shown in a fresco in the Tomb of the Charuns, and each appear to have sub-names. These areCharun Chunchules, the heavily blisteredCharun Huths,Charun Lufe, and the fourth has crumbled away to illegibility.On Laris Pulena's sarcophagus, there are also two Charuns and twoVanthson either side of the figure in the center who is presumably Laris Pulena himself. De Grummond does not cite these figures as assistants, but believes Charun may be a type of creature rather than a singulardemon.\n\nMany of Charun's other presumed assistants appear in the Tomb of the Blue Demons, which is also the home of the only Etruscan rendering of the aforementioned ferry of Charon.\n\nPopular culture\n\n\n## Popular culture\n\n\nIn contemporary times, Charun has never been as popular as his Greek counterpart, though there have been some occurrences.\n\nHe appears in the poem \"Back Matter\" byRachel Blau DuPlessis, invoking the imagery of the Tomb of the Charuns.Charun isMonster in My Pocket#97.  Unlike Ancient depictions, he is bald, bulky, appears to be wearing no clothing, and his wings look leathery (perhaps in reference to Rovin's claim of \"leathery skin\") and lack feathers.[5]A brief reference to Charun inThe Tribune's Curse:SPQR VIIa 2003 novel byJohn Maddox Robertsin an invocation to \"Father Dis\" and related figures, including \"Charun of the hammer\" (p. 65).Charun is referred to in the song \"The one who will not be named\" by the metal bandGWAR\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBonfante, Larissa, and Judith Swaddling.Etruscan Myths.

I hope that scholars also correct and enlarge my list. I can defend much of it -- I have many scans and descriptions of the \"forthcoming\" Etruscan mirrors: the numbers of Etruscan mirrors conserved in what museums. The unsatisfactory times of being unable to cite an Etruscan mirror from a CSE volume is, in respect of my own studies, at an end -- I cite from the official volumes and also from just as many unofficial volumes. (I am similarly updating the volumes of the Body Of Etruscan Inscriptions). Scholars responsible for continuing their partially completed sets of volumes have, spitefully, died, or no longer answer the door at least. Scholars who have announced this volume or that volume have, after a decade, still produced nothing. Volumes eight millimeters thick, which might publish one or two mirrors only but nevertheless plug a gap in coverage, would be most welcome to Etruscan scholars!\n\nAustralia And Japan -- 1 --

  "Daily life of the Etruscans": "Daily life among theEtruscansis difficult to trace, as few literary testimonies are available and Etruscan historiography was highly controversial in the 19th century (seeEtruscology).\n\nMost of our knowledge of the habits and customs of Etruscan daily life is available through detailed observation of the funerary furnishings in their family tombs: decorated urns and sarcophagi, accompanied by everyday objects for both men and women, details of frescoes andbas-reliefs, most of which were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the scientific study of their civilization really began.\n\nPosidonios, a Greek historian, described the richness of the Etruscan table: \"Twice a day, the Etruscans prepared a sumptuous table with all the amenities of a fine life; arranged tablecloths embroidered with flowers; covered the table with a large quantity of silver crockery; had a considerable number of slaves serve them\".This points to the life of wealthy men, quite different from that of the common people.\n\nThe abundant forests of the Etruscan territory enabled the construction of a maritime fleet, as well as mineral exploitation. The prosperity of its trade was based on the export of crafts (bucchero), large quantities of wine and the import of tin fromGaul. From at least the 6th century BC,vine cultivation and wine production have been documented in the region, as evidenced by the manufacture ofamphoraefor transporting wine, which were widely distributed in theTyrrhenianand Mediterranean seas.\n\nEtruscan's diet\n\n\n## Etruscan's diet\n\n\nThe Etruscans' basic dietconsisted mainly of cereal porridge and vegetables. Salt and freshwater fish were certainly part of the diet. Meat consumption was linked to ritual sacrifices and eaten on religious feast days. Thehare, depicted on vases in hunting scenes, was a highly prized game animal. Many kitchen utensils, colanders,amphorae, vases, bronze ladles and typical fish plates are on display in European museums, including theAltes Museum, theLouvreand theNational Etruscan MuseumatVilla Giulia.\n\nTestaroliis anancientpasta that originated from the Etruscan civilization. The bookRustico: Regional Italian Country Cookingstates that testaroli is \"a direct descendant of the porridges of theNeolithic agethat were poured over hot stones to cook\". According to an article published byThe Wall Street Journal, it is \"the earliest recorded pasta\".\n\nThe pomp of abanquet\n\n\n## The pomp of abanquet\n\n\nEtruscan games, also depicted in tomb frescoes, were an important part of their lives.Herodotusrecounts their many games: dice,kottabos, ball (episkyrosorharpastum),Phersu,Askôliasmos, andborsa.\n\nThe Etruscans drew direct inspiration from Greek practices for their pan-Etruscan sports games (Volsinies), pugilism and wrestling, throwing the discus, javelin, long jump, simple foot race or running with weapons (hoplitodromia). Someludi circenses(games), which later the Romans partly took up, were different, such as mounted horse racing (bas-reliefs inPoggio Civitate), acrobatics bydesultores, chariot racing (biga,trigaandquadriga), which theauriga(slaves)practised with the reins tied behind their backs.\n\nThe Romans also took up other games known asludi scaenici, ritual and votive stage games,dance or ballet performances (including the histrionics),whichVarrotells uswere performed by an Etruscan tragedy writer calledVolnius, for a genuinely theatrical purpose.\n\nThe frescoes depict dancers, and musicians playing various instruments. This practice is also present on the many Hellenistic-inspired vases.\n\nSocial rituals\n\n\n## Social rituals\n\n\nThis sectiondoes notciteanysources.Please helpimprove this sectionbyadding citations to reliable sources.

foretell, predict, prophesy')is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of anocculticritual or practice.Using various methods throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how aquerentshould proceed by reading signs, events, oromens, or through alleged contact or interaction withsupernaturalagenciessuch asspirits, gods, god-like-beings or the \"will of theuniverse\".\n\nIn its functional relation tomagicin general, divination can have a preliminary and investigative role:\n\nthe diagnosis or prognosis achieved through divination is both temporarily and logically related to the manipulative, protective or alleviative function of magic rituals. In divination one finds the cause of an ailment or a potential danger, in magic one subsequently acts upon this knowledge.\n\nDivination has long attracted criticism. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by thescientific communityand by skeptics as beingsuperstitious; experiments do not support the idea  that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.In antiquity, divination came under attack from philosophers such as theAcademic skepticCiceroinDe Divinatione(1st century BCE) and thePyrrhonistSextus EmpiricusinAgainst the Astrologers(2nd century CE). The satiristLucian(c.125 – after 180) devoted an essay toAlexander the false prophet.\n\nTheeternal fire at Nymphaionin southernIllyria(present-dayAlbania) also functioned as an oracle. The forms of divination practiced in this natural fire sanctuary with peculiar physical properties were widely known to the ancient Greek and Roman authors.The Oracle ofAmunat theSiwa Oasiswas made famous whenAlexander the Greatvisited it after conquering Egypt from Persia in 332 BC.\n\nDeuteronomy 18:10–12orLeviticus 19:26can be interpreted as categorically forbidding divination. But some biblical practices, such asUrim and Thummim,casting lotsandprayer, are considered to be divination. Trevan G. Hatch disputes these comparisons because divination did not consult the \"one true God\" and manipulated the divine for the diviner's self-interest.One of the earliest known divination artifacts, a book called the Sortes Sanctorum, is believed to be of Christian roots, and utilizes dice to provide insight into the future.\n\nUri Gabbay states that divination was associated with sacrificial rituals in the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia and Israel. Extispicy was a common example, where diviners would pray to their god(s) beforevivisectinga sacrificial animal. Their abdominal organs would reveal a divine message, which aligned withcardiocentricviews of the mind.\n\nOracles and Greek divination\n\n\n#### Oracles and Greek divination\n\n\nBoth oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination.Oracleswere the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles’ limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (Greek:μάντεις).\n\nSeers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods includingextispicy,ornithomancy, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel toDelphior other such distant sites.\n\nBecause the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks,and theStoicsaccounted for the validity of divination in theirphysics.\n\nMiddle Ages and Early Modern period\n\n\n### Middle Ages and Early Modern period\n\n\nnigromancygeomancyhydromancyaeromancypyromancychiromancyscapulimancy\n\nnigromancygeomancyhydromancyaeromancypyromancychiromancyscapulimancy\n\nRelatedBlack magicDivinationGoetiaHistory of magicMagic and religionOccultPsychological theories of magicWestern esotericism\n\nBlack magicDivinationGoetiaHistory of magicMagic and religionOccultPsychological theories of magicWestern esotericism\n\nBlack magicDivinationGoetiaHistory of magicMagic and religionOccultPsychological theories of magicWestern esotericism\n\nThe divination method of casting lots (Cleromancy) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus inActs 1:23–26to select a replacement forJudas Iscariot. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christianemperorsduringancient Rome.\n\nIn 692 theQuinisext Council, also known as the \"Council in Trullo\" in theEastern Orthodox Church, passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices.Fortune-tellingand other forms of divination were widespread through theMiddle Ages.In the constitution of 1572 and public regulations of 1661 of theElectorate of Saxony, capital punishment was used on those predicting the future.Laws forbidding divination practice continue to this day.TheWaldensianssect were accused of practicing divination.\n\nSmålandis famous forÅrsgång, a practice which occurred until the early 19th century in some parts of Småland. Generally occurring on Christmas and New Year's Eve, it is a practice in which one would fast and keep themselves away from light in a room until midnight to then complete a set of complex events to interpret symbols encountered throughout the journey to foresee the coming year.\n\nInIslam,astrology(‘ilm ahkam al-nujum), the most widespread divinatory science, is the study of how celestial entities could be applied to the daily lives of people on earth.It is important to emphasize the practical nature of divinatory sciences because people from all socioeconomic levels and pedigrees sought the advice of astrologers to make important decisions in their lives.Astronomywas made a distinct science by intellectuals who did not agree with the former, although distinction may not have been made in daily practice, where astrology was technically outlawed and only tolerated if it was employed in public. Astrologers, trained as scientists and astronomers, were able to interpret the celestial forces that ruled the \"sub-lunar\" to predict a variety of information fromlunar phasesand drought to times of prayer and the foundation of cities. The courtly sanction and elite patronage ofMuslimrulers benefited astrologers’ intellectual statures.\n\nThe “science of the sand” (‘ilm al-raml), otherwise translated asgeomancy, is “based on the interpretation of figures traced on sand or other surface known asgeomantic figures.”It is a good example of Islamic divination at a popular level. The core principle that meaning derives from a unique occupied position is identical to the core principle of astrology.\n\nLike astronomy, geomancy used deduction and computation to uncover significantpropheciesas opposed toomens(‘ilm al-fa’l), which were process of “reading” visible random events to decipher the invisible realities from which they originated. It was upheld byprophetictradition and relied almost exclusively on text, specifically theQur’an(which carried a table for guidance) and poetry, as a development ofbibliomancy.One example for this is this Qur'an from Gwalior, India, which includes a set of instructions to use the Qur’an as a divinatory text. It is the earliest known example of its kind.The practice culminated in the appearance of the illustrated “Books of Omens” (Falnama) in the early 16th century, an embodiment of the apocalyptic fears as the end of the millennium in theIslamic calendarapproached.\n\nDream interpretation, oroneiromancy(‘ilm ta’bir al-ru’ya), is more specific to Islam than other divinatory science, largely because of the Qur’an’s emphasis on the predictive dreams ofAbraham,Yusuf, andMuhammad. The important delineation within the practice lies between “incoherent dreams” and “sound dreams,” which were “a part of prophecy” or heavenly message.Dream interpretationwas always tied to Islamic religious texts, providing a moral compass to those seeking advice. The practitioner needed to be skilled enough to apply the individual dream to general precedent while appraising the singular circumstances.\n\nThe power of text held significant weight in the \"science of letters\"(‘ilm al-huruf), the foundational principle being \"God created the world through His speech.\"The science began with the concept of language, specificallyArabic, as the expression of \"the essence of what it signifies.\"Once the believer understood this, while remaining obedient to God’s will, they could uncover the essence and divine truth of the objects inscribed with Arabic likeamuletsandtalismansthrough the study of the letters of the Qur’an with alphanumeric computations.\n\nIn Islamic practice inSenegalandGambia, just like many otherWest Africancountries, diviners and religious leaders andhealerswere interchangeable because Islam was closely related with esoteric practices (like divination), which were responsible for the regional spread of Islam. As scholars learned esoteric sciences, they joined local non-Islamic aristocratic courts, who quickly aligned divination and amulets with the \"proof of the power of Islamic religion.\"So strong was the idea of esoteric knowledge in West African Islam, diviners andmagiciansuneducated in Islamic texts and Arabic bore the same titles as those who did.\n\nFrom the beginning of Islam, there \"was (and is) still a vigorous debate about whether or not such [divinatory] practices were actually permissible under Islam,” with some scholars likeAbu-Hamid al Ghazili(d. 1111) objecting to the science of divination because he believed it bore too much similarity topaganpractices of invoking spiritual entities that were not God.Other scholars justified esoteric sciences by comparing a practitioner to \"a physician trying to heal the sick with the help of the same natural principles.\"\n\nMesoamerica\n\n\n### Mesoamerica\n\n\nDivination was a central component of ancientMesoamericanreligious life. ManyAztec gods, including centralcreator gods, were described as diviners and were closely associated withsorcery.Tezcatlipocais the patron of sorcerers and practitioners ofmagic. His name means \"smoking mirror,\" a reference to a device used for divinatoryscrying.In theMayanPopol Vuh, the creator godsXmucane and Xpiacocperform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.The AztecCodex Borbonicusshows the original human couple,OxomocoandCipactonal, engaged in divining with kernels of maize. This primordial pair is associated with the ritual calendar, and the Aztecs considered them to be the first diviners.\n\nEvery civilization that developed inpre-Columbian Mexico, from theOlmecsto theAztecs, practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces,mirrors, or thecasting of lotswere among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice.Visionsderived fromhallucinogenswere another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more commonhallucinogenic plantsused in divination aremorning glory,jimson weed, andpeyote.\n\nContemporary divination in Asia\n\n\n## Contemporary divination in Asia\n\n\nIndia and Nepal\n\n\n### India and Nepal\n\n\nTheyyamor \"theiyam\" inMalayalamis the process by which a devotee invites aHindugod or goddess to use his or her body as a medium or channel and answer other devotees' questions.The same is called \"arulvaakku\" or \"arulvaak\" inTamil, another south Indian language -Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetamis famous for arulvakku inTamil Nadu.The people in and aroundMangaloreinKarnatakacall the same,Buta Kola, \"paathri\" or \"darshin\"; in other parts of Karnataka, it is known by various names such as, \"prashnaavali\", \"vaagdaana\", \"asei\", \"aashirvachana\", and so on.InNepalit is known as, \"Devta ka dhaamee\" or \"jhaakri\".\n\nIn English, the closest translation for these is, \"oracle.\" TheDalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as theNechung Oracle, which is considered the official state oracle of the government ofTibet. The Dalai Lama has according to centuries-old custom, consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities ofLosar.\n\nAlthough Japan retains a history of traditional and localmethods of divination, such asonmyōdō, contemporary divination in Japan, calleduranai, derives from outside sources.Contemporary methods of divination in Japan include both Western and Chineseastrology,geomancyorfeng shui,tarot cards,I Ching(Book of Changes)divination, andphysiognomy(methods of reading the body to identify traits).\n\nPersonality types\n\n\n#### Personality types\n\n\nPersonality typing as a form of divination has been prevalent in Japan since the 1980s. Various methods exist for divining personality type. Each attempt to reveal glimpses of an individual's destiny, productive and inhibiting traits, future parenting techniques, and compatibility in marriage. Personality type is increasingly important for young Japanese, who consider personality the driving factor of compatibility, given the ongoing marriage drought andbirth rate declinein Japan.\n\nAn import to Japan,Chinese zodiacsigns based on the birth year in 12 year cycles (rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, cock, dog, and boar) are frequently combined with other forms of divination, such as so-called 'celestial types' based on the planets (Saturn, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, or Uranus). Personality can also be divined using cardinal directions, thefour elements(water, earth, fire, air), andyin-yang. Names can also lend important personality information under name classification which asserts that names bearing certain Japanese vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o) share common characteristics.Numerology, which utilizes methods of divining 'birth numbers' from significant numbers such as birth date, may also reveal character traits of individuals.\n\nIndividuals can also assess their own and others' personalities according to physical characteristics.Blood typeremains a popular form of divination from physiology. Stemming from Western influences, body reading orninsou, determines personality traits based on body measurements. The face is the most commonly analyzed feature, with eye size, pupil shape, mouth shape, and eyebrow shape representing the most important traits. An upturned mouth may be cheerful, and a triangle eyebrow may indicate that someone is strong-willed.\n\nMethods of assessment in daily life may include self-taken measurements or quizzes. As such, magazines targeted at women in their early-to-mid twenties feature the highest concentration of personality assessment guides. There are approximately 144 different women's magazines, known asnihon zashi koukoku kyoukai, published in Japan aimed at this audience.\n\nJapanese tarot\n\n\n#### Japanese tarot\n\n\nThe adaptation of the Western divination method of tarot cards into Japanese culture presents a particularly unique example of contemporary divination as this adaptation mingles with Japan's robust visual culture. Japanese tarot cards are created by professional artists, advertisers, and fans of tarot. One tarot card collector claimed to have accumulated more than 1,500 Japan-made decks of tarot cards.\n\nJapanese tarot cards fall into diverse categories such as:\n\nInspiration Tarot (reikan tarotto);I-Ching Tarot (ekisen tarotto);Spiritual Tarot (supirichuaru tarotto);Western Tarot (seiyō tarotto); andEastern Tarot (tōyō tarotto).\n\nThe images on tarot cards may come from images from Japanese popular culture, such as characters frommangaandanimeincludingHello Kitty, or may feature cultural symbols. Tarot cards may adapt the images of Japanese historical figures, such as high priestessHimiko(170–248CE) or imperial court wizardAbe no Seimei(921–1005CE). Still others may feature images of cultural displacement, such as English knights,pentagrams, the JewishTorah, or inventedglyphs. The introduction of such cards began by the 1930s and reached prominence 1970s. Japanese tarot cards were originally created by men, often based on theRider-Waite-Smith tarotpublished by the Rider Company in London in 1909.Since, the practice of Japanese tarot has become overwhelmingly feminine and intertwined withkawaiiculture. Referring to the cuteness of tarot cards, Japanese model Kuromiya Niina was quoted as saying \"because the images are cute, even holding them is enjoyable.\"While these differences exist, Japanese tarot cards function similarly to their Western counterparts. Cards are shuffled and cut into piles then used to forecast the future, for spiritual reflection, or as a tool for self-understanding.\n\nA more serious type of divination is the Kiō-á. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, while the incense is being burned, and thedeityis invited to descend onto the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually, the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the deity who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted for the devotees.\n\nContemporary divination in Africa\n\n\n## Contemporary divination in Africa\n\n\nDivinationis widespread throughout Africa. Among many examples it is one of the central tenets ofSerer religionin Senegal. Only those who have been initiated asSaltigues(theSererhigh priests and priestesses) can divine the future.These are the \"hereditary rain priests\"whose role is both religious and medicinal.\n\nDivination of demons\n\n\n## Divination of demons\n\n\nIn his work entitledOn the divination of demons,saintAugustine of Hippoaffirms that, most of the time,demonssimply predict what they do in the future. However, they also possess a divinatory power essentially deriving from the greater acuity of the senses of their aerial bodies and the experience accumulated during their long lives. This allows them to interpret divine signs of the times in the natural world that humans are unable to grasp and to foretell future events, even those that are not immediate. Furthermore, they can cause illnesses and fantastic visions in people in both a sleeping and waking state.The accuracy of the predictions clashes with their evil and deceptive nature, and with God's higher plans that are only known and holy angels can divert and override the signs caught by demons in the natural world.\n\nAstrologyChinese fortune tellingFortune tellingGeomancyJiaobeiKau chimList of occult termsMethods of divinationOneiromancyProphecyQimen DunjiaSandobeleShaobing SongTengenjutsu(fortune telling)Tui bei tu\n\nAstrologyChinese fortune tellingFortune tellingGeomancyJiaobeiKau chimList of occult termsMethods of divinationOneiromancyProphecyQimen DunjiaSandobeleShaobing SongTengenjutsu(fortune telling)Tui bei tu\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n### Works cited\n\n\nGraw, Knut (2012). \"Divination and Islam: Existential Perspectives in the Study of Ritual and Religious Praxis in Senegal and Gambia\".

  "Etruscan architecture": "Etruscan architecturewas created between about 900 BC and 27 BC, when the expanding civilization ofancient Romefinally absorbedEtruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood and other materials of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources we have a good deal of information on what once existed.\n\nFrom about 630 BC, Etruscan architecture was heavily influenced byGreek architecture, which was itself developing through the same period.In turn it influencedRoman architecture, which in its early centuries can be considered as just a regional variation of Etruscan architecture.  But increasingly, from about 200 BC, the Romans looked directly to Greece for their styling, while sometimes retaining Etruscan shapes and purposes in their buildings.\n\nThe main monumental forms of Etruscan architecture, listed in decreasing order of the surviving remains, were: the houses of the wealthy elite, the mysterious \"monumental complexes\", temples, city walls, and rock-cut tombs.  Apart from the podia of temples and some house foundations, only the walls androck-cuttombs were mainly in stone, and have therefore often largely survived.\n\nThe early Etruscans seem to have worshipped in open air enclosures, marked off but not built over; sacrifices continued to be performed outside rather than inside temples in traditionalRoman religionuntil its end. It was only around 600 BC, at the height of their civilization, that they began to create monumental temples, undoubtedly influenced by the Greeks.That these buildings developed essentially from the largest types of Etruscan house has been both asserted and challenged.\n\nUsually, only thepodiumor base platform used stone, with the upper parts of wood and mud-brick, greatly reducing what survives for archaeologists.However, there is evidence for the portico columns sometimes using stone, as atVeii.This has left much about Etruscan temples uncertain. The only written account of significance on their architecture is byVitruvius(died after 15 BC), writing some two centuries after the Etruscan civilization was absorbed by Rome. He describes how to plan a \"Tuscan temple\" that appears to be a Roman \"Etruscan-style\" (tuscanicae dispositiones) temple of a type perhaps still sometimes built in his own day, rather than a really historically minded attempt to describe original Etruscan buildings, though he may well have seen examples of these.\n\nMany aspects of his description fit what archaeologists can demonstrate, but others do not. It is in any case clear that Etruscan temples could take a number of forms, and also varied over the 400-year period during which they were being made.Nonetheless, Vitruvius remains the inevitable starting point for a description, and a contrast of Etruscan temples with theirGreekandRomanequivalents.  There are also a few model temples in pottery, and depictions on tombs or vases. Remains of the architectural terracotta elements sometimes survive in considerable quantities, and museums, mostly in Italy, have good collections of attractively shaped and paintedantefixesin particular.\n\nVitruvius specifies three doors and threecellae, one for each of the main Etruscan deities, but archaeological remains do not suggest this was normal, though it is found.Roman sources were in the habit of ascribing to the Etruscans a taste for triads in things such as city planning (with three gates to cities, for example), in ways that do not seem to reflect reality.The orientation of the temple is not consistent, and may have been determined by a priest watching the flight of birds at the time of foundation.\n\nThe exteriors of both Greek and Roman temples were originally highly decorated and colourful, especially in theentablatureand roofs, and this was if anything even more true of Etruscan temples. When wood was used for columns, the bases and capitals were often encased in painted terracotta.All the edges of the roof were decorated, mostly in brightly painted terracotta, and there seem often to have been a row of sculptures along the central ridge of the roof, going beyond theacroteriongroup above apedimentin Greek and Roman temples. TheApollo of Veiiwas part of an acroterion group.Substantial but broken remains of late sculptured pediment groups survive in museums, in fact rather more than from Greek or Roman temples, partly because the terracotta was not capable of \"recycling\" asmarblewas.  The groups fromLuniandTalamone(both now inFlorence) are among the most impressive.\n\nFeatures shared by typical Etruscan and Roman temples, and contrasting with Greek ones, begin with a strongly frontal approach, with great emphasis on the front facade, less on the sides, and very little on the back. The podia are also usually higher, and can only be entered at a section of the front, just presenting a blank platform wall elsewhere.  There may only be columns at the front portico.In Etruscan temples, more than Roman ones, the portico is deep, often representing, as Vitruvius recommends, half of the area under the roof, with multiple rows of columns.\n\nAt least in later temples, versions of GreekAeolic,IonicandCorinthiancapitals are found, as well as the mainTuscan order, a simpler version of theDoric, but the attention to the full Greek detailing in the entablature that the Romans pursued seems to have been lacking.FlutedTuscan/Doric columns can also be found, against Greek and later Roman conventions.\n\nEtruscan architecture shared withAncient Egyptian architecturethe use of largecavettomouldings as acornice, though not on the same massive scale. The cavetto took the place of the Greekcymatiumin many temples, often painted with vertical \"tongue\" patterns (as in the reconstructed Etruscan temple atVilla Giulia, illustrated above), and combined with the distinctive \"Etruscan round moulding\", often painted with scales.\n\nTemple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus\n\n\n### Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus\n\n\nThe first building of theTemple of Jupiter Optimus Maximuson theCapitoline Hillwas the oldest large temple in Rome, dedicated to theCapitoline Triadconsisting of Jupiter and his companion deities,JunoandMinerva, and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome. Its first version was traditionally dedicated in 509 BC,but in 83 BC it was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt as a Greek-style temple, which was completed in 69 BC (there were to be two more fires and new buildings). For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of theentablatureor upper parts, such asantefixes.But for the second building they were summoned from Greece.\n\nThe first version is the largest Etruscan temple recorded,and much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after.  However, its size remains heavily disputed by specialists; based on an ancient visitor it has been claimed to have been almost 60 m × 60 m (200 ft × 200 ft), not far short of the largest Greek temples.Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting.Reconstructions usually show very wide eaves, and a wide colonnade stretching down the sides, though not round the back wall as it would have done in a Greek temple.A crude image on a coin of 78 BC shows only four columns, and a very busyroofline.\n\nTemple plan, following Vitruvius and thePortonaccioMinerva temple, with three doorsTemple of Apollo,Veii, with partial modern visualizationSt Paul's, Covent Garden, London, 1630s, largely followsVitruvius's directions for a \"Tuscan temple\", but lacks external decoration and colour.Gorgonantefix,Orvieto, end of the 5th century BC.  Heads of both Silenus and gorgons were common subjects for antefixes.Winged-Horses of Tarquinia, 4th century BC\n\nMonumental complexes\n\n\n## Monumental complexes\n\n\n\"Monumental complex\" or building is a term used for a few large sets of buildings relatively recently uncovered by archaeology, the term reflecting a lack of certainty over their function. The two leading examples arethe Archaic buildingatPoggio Civitateand another atAcquarossa(Zone F); both are 6th-century or earlier.  Both have sets of buildings round a courtyard, which use stone, at least in the foundations, roof tiles, and elaborate decorations in architectural terracotta.  Their size is exceptional for their early date. One obvious possible function is as palatial dwellings; another is as civic buildings, acting as places for assembly, and commemoration of aspects of the community.  Only the stone foundations and ceramic fragments remain for excavations to discover.\n\nIt seems clear from the richer tombs that the Etruscan elite lived in fairly spacious comfort, but there is little evidence as to what their homes looked like, although some furniture is shown in tomb frescos.  The rock-cut tomb chambers often form suites of \"rooms\", some quite large, which presumably resemble in part theatriumhomes of the better-off Etruscans.Unlike several of the necropoli, Etruscan cities have generally been built over from the Romans onwards, and houses have left little trace. Where remains survive, there are tightly packedtufabases, with perhaps mud-brick above, but in some places the lower parts of tufa walls survive even in small houses.  One complete set of foundations shows a house 7.9m by 3.9m (25 x 13 feet).At large farms, mines, quarries and perhaps other sites employing many people, workers lived in dormitories.\n\nA form of models of houses in pottery, and sometimes bronze, called \"hut urns\" gives us some indications. These were apparently used to hold cremated ashes, and are found in the Etruscan Iron AgeVillanovan cultureand early burials, especially in northern areas.The hut urns show a conventional model with a single interior space.  They are usually round or slightly oval, often with prominent wooden beams laid in two rows on the sloping roof, which cross at the central ridge and project some way in \"V\"s into the air; these projections seem to have been sometimes carved or otherwise decorated.  The urns always have a large square-ish door for access, sometimes two, and the outline of windows in the walls may be indicated by ridges or marks in the clay.  There is very often a window and exit for smoke, above the door in the roof, and at the opposite end.\n\nSuch houses were made of earth and organic materials, using mud brick andwattle and daub.Stonehearthsand perhaps stone rings at the base are found.  Even the well-off seem rarely to have lived in stone houses, and rock-cut tomb chambers often represent wooden ceilings in stone.  The \"Tomb of the Reliefs\" at Banditaccia suggests that possessions such as tools and weapons were often hung from the walls for storage.\n\nOn thePalatine Hillin Rome, theCasa Romuli(\"House ofRomulus\") was long preserved, and when necessary rebuilt as before.  It was a hut made of wood posts and roof beams, wattle and daub walls and athatchedroof,and possibly typical of ordinary Etruscan housing outside crowded city centres.The site cannot be identified with certainty, but at one candidate location circle of sixpost-holesplus a central one have been found, cut into thetufabedrock, with an ovoid 4.9m x 3.6m perimeter.\n\nTombs and tumuli\n\n\n## Tombs and tumuli\n\n\nRich Etruscans left elaborate tombs, mostly gathered in largenecropolisome way outside their cities.  These were generously filled withgrave goods,especially ceramics, which give us most of our understanding of Etruscan culture.Typically, in the tufa regions of southern Etruria, the burial chamber was cut from solid rock below ground, which is relatively easy with this rock, but there was a structure above, often rather large. In other regions they are normally built up above ground.They were reused for further burials in the same family over several generations, and would often have become very crowded with sarcophagi and grave goods, though the known survivals have now been emptied, either by looters or archaeologists.\n\nSome tombs are stone buildings, often in rows, rather like small houses. Others are roundtumuliwith stone retaining walls, with steps down to rock-cut chambers below. Both types are found closely packed together in necropoli likeBanditacciaandMonterozzi, the latter containing some 6,000 burials. Several different types of tombs have been identified, reflecting a development through time as well as differences in income.  Some types clearly replicate aspects of the richer houses, with a number of connected chambers, columns with capitals, and rock-cut ceilings given beams.Many tombs hadfrescopaintings, which does not seem to have been a Greek influence (though the style of the paintings are certainly based on Greek art), as the Greeks had ceased to usechamber tombswell before the Etruscans started to paint theirs in about 600; the Egyptians had also ceased painting tombs by then.Womb tombswere also regularly constructed for burying the deceased.\n\nVillanovan periodtombs for cremation burials,Necropolis of MonterozziTombs atBanditaccianecropolisTombs atBanditaccianecropolisTumulus atBanditaccianecropolisMaze of tumuli atBanditaccianecropolisView from above of a crowded necropolis atOrvietoTomb entry atBanditaccianecropolisPaintedfalse door; the \"hammerhead\" surround is a frequent motif\n\nWalls and fortifications\n\n\n## Walls and fortifications\n\n\nEtruscan cities, which often sat on hill-tops, became walled from about the 8th century, first in mud-brick, then often in stone. The Romans considered thesulcus primigenius—the sanctification of the course of a future city wall through a ritualplowing—to have been a continuation of similar Etruscan practices. Even before the Romans began to swallow up Etruscan territory, Italy had frequent wars, and by the later period hadCelticenemies to the north, and an expanding Rome to the south.There was anaggeror rampart and afossaor ditch in front of the wall.  The towns had a number of gates where roads entered, which were sometimes given arched gateways.  The best survivor of these is the 2nd-century Porta Marzia atPerugia, from the end of the period. Here, as in many cases, surviving work comes from the period just around the Roman takeover, but appears to represent Etruscan traditions.  By the 4th century,Volterrahad two walls, the second enclosing the whole city.\n\nThe stonework is often of fine quality, sometimes using regular rectangular blocks in a roughashlar, and sometimes \"cyclopeian\", using large polygonal blocks, partly shaped to fit each other, somewhat in the manner of the well-knownInca masonry, though not reaching that level of quality.  Gaps are left, which are filled in with much smaller stones.\n\nFiesole, town wall. Fairly regular blocks in coursesThe 2nd-century Porta Marzia atPerugia, its upper part built into a later wallPolygonal masonry wall atRusellae\n\nRoad network\n\n\n## Road network\n\n\nSeveral important and unimportantRoman roads, such as theVia Cassia, overlie Etruscan precursors, but there are sufficient Etruscan sites that were neglected after their conquest to allow an understanding of the considerable Etruscan road system. Roads did not just run between cities, but out into the countryside to allow agricultural produce to be easily brought in.While not as heavily engineered as Roman roads, considerable efforts went into creating a road surface that on major routes could be as wide as 10.4 metres, on a 12 kilometre stretch connectingCerveteriwith its portPyrgi, made in the 5th century.  This had a gravel surface, between tufo edging-blocks, and a central drainage channel.\n\nTheVie Cave, narrow cuttings often running deeply through hills, are probably little changed since Etruscan times.  As well as connecting sites, these may have had a defensive function in times of war.  Their construction may have mainly resulted from the wearing through soft tufo bedrock by iron-rimmed wheels, creating deep ruts that required the road to be frequently recut to a smooth surface.  Their dating can only be deduced by that of settlements they pass between, and objects from tombs beside them.The 7th and 6th centuries BC show a move to replace earlier tracks only suitable for mules and pedestrians with wider and more engineered roads capable of taking wheeled vehicles, using gentler but longer routes through hilly country.\n\nBridges were common, though fords more so where these would suffice.  Presumably many were in timber, but some at least used stone underneath a timber roadway.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related toEtruscan architecture.\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related toEtruscan architecture.\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related toEtruscan architecture.\n\nBanti, Luisa,Etruscan Cities and Their Culture, 1973, University of California Press,ISBN0520019105,978-0520019102Boardman, Johned.,The Oxford History of Classical Art, 1993, OUP,ISBN0198143869Axel Boëthius, Roger Ling, Tom Rasmussen,Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture, Yale University Press Pelican history of art, 1978, Yale University Press,ISBN0300052901,978-0300052909,google booksCristofani, Mauro, et al. \"Etruscan; Architecture\",Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online.

  "Etruscan civilization": "TheEtruscan civilization(/ɪˈtrʌskən/ih-TRUS-kən) was an ancient civilization created by the Etruscans, a people who inhabitedEtruriainancient Italy, with a common language and culture, and formed a federation ofcity-states.After adjacent lands had been conquered its territory covered, at its greatest extent, roughly what is nowTuscany, westernUmbriaand northernLazio,as well as what are now thePo Valley,Emilia-Romagna, south-easternLombardy, southernVenetoand westernCampania.\n\nA large body of literature has flourished on the origins of the Etruscans, but the consensus among modern scholars is that the Etruscans were an indigenous population.The earliest evidence of aculturethat is identifiably Etruscan dates from about 900 BC.This is the period of theIron AgeVillanovan culture, considered to be the earliest phase of Etruscan civilization,which itself developed from the previous late Bronze AgeProto-Villanovan culturein the same region,part of the central EuropeanUrnfield culturesystem. Etruscan civilization dominated Italy until it fell tothe expanding Romebeginning in the late 4th century BC as a result of theRoman–Etruscan Wars;Etruscans were grantedRoman citizenshipin 90 BC and in 27 BC the whole Etruscan territory was incorporated into the newly establishedRoman Empire.\n\nThe territorial extent of Etruscan civilization reached its maximum around 500 BC, shortly after theRoman Kingdombecame theRoman Republic. Its culture flourished in three confederacies of cities: that ofEtruria(Tuscany, Latium and Umbria), that of thePo Valleywith the easternAlps, and that ofCampania.The league in northern Italy is mentioned inLivy.The reduction in Etruscan territory was gradual, but after 500 BC the political balance of power on the Italian peninsula shifted away from the Etruscans in favor of the risingRoman Republic.\n\nThe earliest-known examples of Etruscan writing are inscriptions found in southernEtruriathat date to around 700 BC.The Etruscans developed a system of writing derived from theEuboean alphabet, which was used in theMagna Graeciacoastal areas inSouthern Italy. TheEtruscan languageremains only partly understood, making modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on much later and generally disapproving Roman and Greek sources. In the Etruscan political system authority resided in its individual small cities and probably in its prominent individual families. At the height of Etruscan power, elite Etruscan families grew very rich through trade with theCeltsto the north and the Greeks to the south, and they filled their large family tombs with imported luxuries.\n\nLegend and history\n\n\n## Legend and history\n\n\nEthnonym and etymology\n\n\n### Ethnonym and etymology\n\n\nAccording toDionysiusthe Etruscans called themselvesRasenna(Greek Ῥασέννα), a stem from the Etruscan Rasna (𐌛𐌀𐌔𐌍𐌀), the people. Evidence of inscriptions as Tular Rasnal (𐌕𐌖𐌋𐌀𐌛 𐌛𐌀𐌔𐌍𐌀𐌋), \"boundary of the people\", or Mechlum Rasnal (𐌌𐌄𐌙𐌋 𐌛𐌀𐌔𐌍𐌀𐌋). \"community of the people\", attest to its autonym usage. TheTyrsenianetymology, however, remains unknown.\n\nInAttic Greekthe Etruscans were known asTyrrhenians(Τυρρηνοί,Tyrrhēnoi, earlierΤυρσηνοίTyrsēnoi),from which the Romans derived the namesTyrrhēnī,Tyrrhēnia(Etruria),andMare Tyrrhēnum(Tyrrhenian Sea).\n\nThe ancient Romans referred to the Etruscans as theTuscīorEtruscī(singularTuscus).Their Roman name is the origin of the termsToscana, which refers to their heartland, andEtruria, which can refer to their wider region. The termTusciis thought by linguists to have been the Umbrian word for Etruscan, based on an inscription on anancient bronze tabletfrom a nearby region.The inscription contains the phraseturskum ... nomen, literally ‘the Tuscan name’. Based on a knowledge of Umbrian grammar, linguists can infer that the base form of the word turskum is *Tursci,which would, throughmetathesisand a word-initialepenthesis, be likely to lead to the form,E-trus-ci.\n\nAs for the original meaning of the root, *Turs-, a widely cited hypothesis is that it, like the Latinturris, means ‘tower’ and comes from the ancient Greek word for tower:τύρσις,likely a loan into Greek. On this hypothesis, the Tusci were called the ‘people who build towers\"or \"the tower builders\".This proposed etymology is made the more plausible because the Etruscans preferred to build their towns on high precipices reinforced by walls. Alternatively,GiulianoandLarissa Bonfantehave speculated that Etruscan houses may have seemed like towers to the simple Latins.The proposed etymology has a long history,Dionysius of Halicarnassushaving observed in the first century BC, \"[T]here is no reason that the Greeks should not have called [the Etruscans] by this name, both from their living in towers and from the name of one of their rulers.\"In his recentEtymological Dictionary of Greek, Robert Beekes claims the Greek word is a \"loanword from a Mediterranean language\", a hypothesis that goes back to an article byPaul KretschmerinGlottafrom 1934.\n\nAncient sources\n\n\n#### Ancient sources\n\n\nLiterary and historical texts in the Etruscan language have not survived, and the language itself is only partially understood by modern scholars. This makes modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on much later and generally disapproving Roman and Greek sources. These ancient writers differed in their theories about the origin of the Etruscan people. Some suggested they werePelasgianswho had migrated there from Greece. Others maintained that they were indigenous to central Italy.\n\nThe first Greek author to mention the Etruscans, whom the Ancient Greeks calledTyrrhenians, was the 8th-century BC poetHesiodin his work theTheogony. He mentioned them as residing in central Italy alongside the Latins.The 7th-century BCHomeric Hymnto Dionysusreferred to them as pirates.Unlike later Greek authors, these authors did not suggest that Etruscans had migrated to Italy from the east and did not associate them with the Pelasgians.\n\nIt was only in the 5th century BC, when the Etruscan civilization had been established for several centuries, that Greek writers started associating the name \"Tyrrhenians\" with the \"Pelasgians\", and even then some did so in a way that suggests they were meant only as generic, descriptive labels for \"non-Greek\" and \"indigenous ancestors of Greeks\" respectively.The 5th-century BC historiansHerodotus,andThucydidesand the 1st-century BC historianStrabo,did seem to suggest that the Tyrrhenians were originally Pelasgians who migrated to Italy fromLydiaby way of the Greek island ofLemnos. They all described Lemnos as having been settled by Pelasgians, whom Thucydides identified as \"belonging to the Tyrrhenians\" (τὸ δὲ πλεῖστον Πελασγικόν, τῶν καὶ Λῆμνόν ποτε καὶ Ἀθήνας Τυρσηνῶν). As Strabo and Herodotus told it,the migration to Lemnos was led byTyrrhenus/ Tyrsenos, the son ofAtys(who was king of Lydia). Straboadded that the Pelasgians of Lemnos andImbrosthen followed Tyrrhenus to theItalian Peninsula. According to the logographerHellanicus of Lesbos, there was a Pelasgian migration fromThessalyin Greece to the Italian peninsula, as part of which the Pelasgians colonized the area he called Tyrrhenia, and they then came to be called Tyrrhenians.\n\nThere is some evidence suggesting a link between Lemnos and the Tyrrhenians. TheLemnos stelebears inscriptions in a language with strong structural resemblances to the language of the Etruscans.The discovery of these inscriptions in modern times has led to the suggestion of a \"Tyrrhenian language group\" consisting of Etruscan, Lemnian, and theRaeticspoken in theAlps.\n\nΤhis is aligned with the famous and largely debated testimony of Herodotus:\"The emigrants went down to Smyrna and built ships, and sailed away in search of a livelihood. After passing many nations, they came to the land of the Ombricans, where they built cities and have lived ever since. They no longer called themselves Lydians, but after the name of the king's son who led them out, they called themselves Tyrrhenians.” (Herodotus)\n\nHerodotus also mentions the existence of a tribe called Tyrsenioi/Tyrrhenoi in Central Macedonia:\n''\"based on the Pelasgians, who even now dwell above the Tyrrhenians in the city of Creston and who were once neighbors of those now called Dorians (for at that time the Pelasgians inhabited the land which is now called Thessaliotis).\"By this Herodotus refers to Creston, a city/region in Macedonia, and that Pelasgians are residing above the Tyrsinoi that are known by Thucydides to dwell in the Athos Peninshula (Acte).\n\nIn Acte were settled barbarian peoples, mixed and bilingual, and a small number of Chalcidians; but the greater part were Pelasgians Tyrrhenians from Lemnos and Athens, alongside Visaltai, Kristones, and Idones.(Thucydides)\n\nBut the 1st-century BC historianDionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek living in Rome, dismissed many of the ancient theories of other Greek historians and postulated that the Etruscans were indigenous people who had always lived in Etruria and were different from both the Pelasgians and the Lydians.Dionysius noted that the 5th-century historianXanthus of Lydia, who was originally fromSardisand was regarded as an important source and authority for the history of Lydia, never suggested a Lydian origin of the Etruscans and never named Tyrrhenus as a ruler of the Lydians.\n\nFor this reason, therefore, I am persuaded that the Pelasgians are a different people from the Tyrrhenians. And I do not believe, either, that the Tyrrhenians were a colony of the Lydians; for they do not use the same language as the latter, nor can it be alleged that, though they no longer speak a similar tongue, they still retain some other indications of their mother country. For they neither worship the same gods as the Lydians nor make use of similar laws or institutions, but in these very respects they differ more from the Lydians than from the Pelasgians. Indeed, those probably come nearest to the truth who declare that the nation migrated from nowhere else, but was native to the country, since it is found to be a very ancient nation and to agree with no other either in its language or in its manner of living.\n\nThe credibility of Dionysius of Halicarnassus is arguably bolstered by the fact that he was the first ancient writer to report theendonymof the Etruscans: Rasenna.\n\nThe Romans, however, give them other names: from the country they once inhabited, named Etruria, they call them Etruscans, and from their knowledge of the ceremonies relating to divine worship, in which they excel others, they now call them, rather inaccurately, Tusci, but formerly, with the same accuracy as the Greeks, they called them Thyrscoï [an earlier form of Tusci]. Their own name for themselves, however, is the same as that of one of their leaders, Rasenna.\n\nSimilarly, the 1st-century BC historianLivy, in hisAb Urbe Condita Libri, said that the Rhaetians were Etruscans who had been driven into the mountains by the invading Gauls; and he asserted that the inhabitants of Raetia were of Etruscan origin.\n\nThe Alpine tribes have also, no doubt, the same origin (of the Etruscans), especially the Raetians; who have been rendered so savage by the very nature of the country as to retain nothing of their ancient character save the sound of their speech, and even that is corrupted.\n\nThe first-century historianPliny the Elderalso put the Etruscans in the context of theRhaetian peopleto the north, and wrote in hisNatural History(AD 79):\n\nAdjoining these the (Alpine)Noricansare the Raeti andVindelici. All are divided into a number of states. The Raeti are believed to be people of Tuscan race driven out by theGauls, their leader was named Raetus.\n\nArcheological evidence and modern etruscology\n\n\n#### Archeological evidence and modern etruscology\n\n\nThe question of the Etruscans' origins has long been a subject of interest and debate among historians. In modern times, all the evidence gathered by prehistoric and protohistoric archaeologists, anthropologists, and etruscologists points to an autochthonous origin of the Etruscans.There is no archaeological or linguistic evidence of a migration of the Lydians or Pelasgians into Etruria.Modernetruscologistsand archeologists, such asMassimo Pallottino(1947), have shown that early historians' assumptions and assertions on the subject were groundless.In 2000, the etruscologistDominique Briquelexplained in detail why he believes that ancient Greek narratives on Etruscan origins should not even count as historical documents.He argues that the ancient story of the Etruscans' 'Lydian origins' was a deliberate, politically motivated fabrication, and that ancient Greeks inferred a connection between the Tyrrhenians and the Pelasgians solely on the basis of certain Greek and local traditions and because there had been trade between the Etruscans and Greeks.He noted that, even if these stories include historical facts suggesting contact, such contact is more plausibly traceable to cultural exchange than to migration.\n\nSeveral archaeologists specializing inPrehistoryandProtohistorywho have analyzed Bronze Age and Iron Age remains that were excavated in the territory of historical Etruria have pointed out that no evidence has been found, related either tomaterial cultureor tosocial practices, to support a migration theory.The most marked and radical change that has been archaeologically attested in the area is the adoption, starting in about the 12th century BC, of the funeral rite of incineration in terracotta urns, a Continental European practice derived from theUrnfield culture; nothing about it suggests an ethnic contribution fromAsia Minoror theNear East.\n\nA 2012 survey of the previous 30 years' archaeological findings based on excavations of the major Etruscan cities showed a continuity of culture from the last phase of the Bronze Age (13th–11th century BC) to the Iron Age (10th–9th century BC). This is evidence that the Etruscan civilization, which emerged around 900 BC, was built by people whose ancestors had inhabited that region for at least the previous 200 years.Based on this cultural continuity, there is now a consensus among archeologists that Proto-Etruscan culture developed, during the last phase of the Bronze Age, from the indigenousProto-Villanovan cultureand that the subsequent Iron AgeVillanovan cultureis most accurately described as an early phase of the Etruscan civilization.It is possible that there were contacts between northern-central Italy and theMycenaean worldat the end of the Bronze Age, but contacts between the inhabitants of Etruria and inhabitants ofGreece,Aegean SeaIslands, Asia Minor, and the Near East are attested only centuries later, when Etruscan civilization was already flourishing and Etruscanethnogenesiswas well established. The first of these attested contacts relate to theGreek colonies in Southern ItalyandPhoenician-Puniccolonies inSardinia, and the consequentorientalizing period.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes for a long time, even among some scholars of the past, has been to associate the laterOrientalizing periodof Etruscan civilization with the question of its origins. Orientalization was an artistic and cultural phenomenon that spread among the Greeks themselves and throughout much of the central and western Mediterranean, not only in Etruria.The Etruscan orientalizing period was due, as has been amply demonstrated by archeologists, to contacts with the Greeks and the Eastern Mediterranean and not to mass migrations.The facial features (the profile, almond-shaped eyes, large nose) in the frescoes and sculptures and the depiction of reddish-brown men and light-skinned women, influenced by archaic Greek art, followed the artistic traditions from the Eastern Mediterranean that had spread even among the Greeks themselves, and to a lesser extent also to several other civilizations in the central and western Mediterranean up to theIberian Peninsula. Actually, many of the tombs of the Late Orientalizing and Archaic periods, such as theTomb of the Augurs, theTomb of the Tricliniumand theTomb of the Leopards, as well as other tombs from the archaic period in theMonterozzi necropolisinTarquinia, were painted by Greek painters or at least foreign artists. These images have, therefore, a very limited value for a realistic representation of the Etruscan population.It was only from the end of the 4th century BC that evidence of physiognomic portraits began to be found in Etruscan art and Etruscan portraiture became more realistic.\n\nArcheogenetics\n\n\n#### Archeogenetics\n\n\nThere have been numerous biological studies on the Etruscan origins, the oldest of which dates to the 1950s, when research was still based on blood tests of modern samples and DNA analysis (including the analysis of ancient samples) was not yet possible.Only very recently, with the development ofarchaeogenetics, have comprehensive studies containing thewhole genome sequencingof Etruscan samples been published, includingautosomal DNAandY-DNA, autosomal DNA being the \"most valuable to understand what really happened in an individual's history\", as stated by geneticistDavid Reich, whereas previously studies were based only onmitochondrial DNAanalysis, which contains less and limited information.\n\nAn archeogenetic study focusing on Etruscan origins was published in September 2021 in the journalScience Advancesand analyzed theautosomal DNAand the uniparental markers (Y-DNA and mtDNA) of 48 Iron Age individuals fromTuscanyandLazio, spanning from 800 to 1 BC and concluded that the Etruscans were autochthonous (locally indigenous) and had a genetic profile similar to their Latin neighbors. In the Etruscan individuals the ancestral componentSteppewas present in the same percentages as those found in the previously analyzed Iron Age Latins, and the Etruscan DNA bore no trace of recent admixture with Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean. Both Etruscans and Latins were firmly part of the European cluster, west of modern Italians. The Etruscans were a mixture of WHG, EEF and Steppe ancestry; 75% of the Etruscan male individuals were found to belong tohaplogroup R1b (R1b M269), especially its cladeR1b-P312and its derivativeR1b-L2, whose direct ancestor isR1b-U152, whilst the most common mitochondrial DNA haplogroup among the Etruscans wasH.\n\nThe conclusions of the 2021 study are in line with a 2019 study published in the journalSciencethat analyzed the remains of elevenIron Ageindividuals from the areas around Rome, of whom four were Etruscan, one buried inVeio Grotta Gramicciafrom the Villanovan era (900-800 BC) and three buried in La Mattonara Necropolis nearCivitavecchiafrom the Orientalizing period (700-600 BC). The study concluded that Etruscans (900–600 BC) and theLatins(900–500 BC) fromLatium vetuswere genetically similar,with genetic differences between the examined Etruscans and Latins found to be insignificant.The Etruscan individuals and contemporary Latins were distinguished from preceding populations of Italy by the presence ofc.30%steppe ancestry.Their DNA was a mixture of two-thirdsCopper Ageancestry (EEF+WHG; Etruscans ~66–72%, Latins ~62–75%) and one-thirdSteppe-related ancestry(Etruscans ~27–33%, Latins ~24–37%).The only sample ofY-DNAbelonged tohaplogroup J-M12 (J2b-L283), found in an individual dated 700-600 BC, and carried the M314 derived allele also found in a Middle Bronze Age individual fromCroatia(1631–1531 BC).  The four samples ofmtDNAextracted belonged to haplogroupsU5a1,H,T2b32,K1a4.\n\nAmong the older studies, based only on mitochondrial DNA, a mtDNA study, published in 2018 in theAmerican Journal of Physical Anthropologycompared both ancient and modern samples from Tuscany, fromPrehistory, the Etruscan age,Roman age,Renaissanceand the present day and concluded that the Etruscans appear to be a local population, intermediate between the prehistoric and the other samples, placing them in the temporal network between theEneolithic Ageand the Roman Age.\n\nA couple ofmitochondrial DNAstudies published in 2013 in the journalsPLOS OneandAmerican Journal of Physical Anthropology, based on Etruscan samples from Tuscany and Latium, concluded that the Etruscans were an indigenous population, showing that Etruscan mtDNA appears to be very close to a Neolithic population fromCentral Europe(Germany,Austria,Hungary) and to other Tuscan populations, strongly suggesting that the Etruscan civilization developed locally from theVillanovan culture, as supported by archaeological evidence and anthropological research,and that genetic links between Tuscany and westernAnatoliadate to at least 5,000 years ago during theNeolithicand the \"most likely separation time between Tuscany and Western Anatolia falls around 7,600 years ago\", at the time of the migrations ofEarly European Farmers(EEF) from Anatolia to Europe in the early Neolithic. The ancient Etruscan samples had mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (mtDNA)JT(subclades ofJandT) andU5, with a minority ofmtDNA H1b.\n\nAn mtDNA study published in 2004, based on about 28 samples of individuals who lived from 600 to 100 BC inVeneto, Etruria and Campania, found that the Etruscans had no significant heterogeneity and that all mitochondrial lineages observed among the Etruscan samples appear typically European orWest Asianbut only a fewhaplotypeswere shared with modern populations. Allele sharing between the Etruscans and modern populations is highest amongGermans(seven haplotypes in common), theCornishfrom the South West of Britain (five haplotypes in common), theTurks(four haplotypes in common) and theTuscans(two haplotypes in common).The modern populations with the shortest genetic distance from the ancient Etruscans, based solely on mtDNA and FST, wereTuscansfollowed by the Turks, other populations from the Mediterranean and the Cornish after.This study was much criticized by other geneticists, because \"data represent severely damaged or partly contaminated mtDNA sequences\" and \"any comparison with modern population data must be considered quite hazardous\",and by archaeologists, who argued that the study was not clear-cut and had not provided evidence that the Etruscans were an intrusive population to the European context.\n\nIn the collective volumeEtruscologypublished in 2017, British archeologist Phil Perkins, echoing an article of his from 2009, provides an analysis of the state of DNA studies and writes, \"none of the DNA studies to date conclusively prove that [the] Etruscans were an intrusive population in Italy that originated in the Eastern Mediterranean or Anatolia\" and \"there are indications that the evidence of DNA can support the theory that Etruscan people are autochthonous in central Italy\".\n\nIn his 2021 bookA Short History of Humanity, German geneticistJohannes Krause, codirector of theMax Planck Institute for Evolutionary AnthropologyinJena, concludes that it is likely that theEtruscan language(as well asBasque,Paleo-SardinianandMinoan) \"developed on the continent in the course of theNeolithic Revolution\".\n\nPeriodization of Etruscan civilization\n\n\n### Periodization of Etruscan civilization\n\n\nThe Etruscan civilization begins with the early Iron AgeVillanovan culture, regarded as the oldest phase, that occupied a large area of northern and central Italy during the Iron Age.The Etruscans themselves dated their nation's origin to a date corresponding to the 11th or 10th century BC.The Villanovan culture emerges with the phenomenon of regionalization from the late Bronze Age culture called \"Proto-Villanovan\", part of the central EuropeanUrnfield culture system. In the last Villanovan phase, called the recent phase (about 770–730 BC), the Etruscans established relations of a certain consistency with the firstGreek immigrants in southern Italy(inPithecusaand then inCuma), so much so as to initially absorb techniques and figurative models and soon more properly cultural models, with the introduction, for example, of writing, of a new way of banqueting, of a heroic funerary ideology, that is, a new aristocratic way of life, such as to profoundly change the physiognomy of Etruscan society.Thus, thanks to the growing number of contacts with the Greeks, the Etruscans entered what is called theorientalizing period. In this phase, there was a heavy influence in Greece, most of Italy and some areas of Spain, from the most advanced areas of theeastern Mediterraneanand theancient Near East.Also directly Phoenician, or otherwise Near Eastern, craftsmen, merchants and artists contributed to the spread in southern Europe of Near Eastern cultural and artistic motifs. The last three phases of Etruscan civilization are called, respectively, Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic, which roughly correspond to the homonymous phases of the ancient Greek civilization.\n\nChronology\n\n\n#### Chronology\n\n\nEtruscan expansion was concentrated both in the north, beyond the Apennines, and in Campania, although the Etruscan presence in the Emilia-Romagna area, according to archaeologists, was not due to a recent expansion but to a much older presence. However, it is thought that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than,Magna Graeciain the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especiallycopperandiron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the westernMediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, whenPhocaeansof Italy founded colonies along the coast ofSardinia,SpainandCorsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves withCarthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks.\n\nAround 540 BC, theBattle of Alalialed to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner,Carthagemanaged to expand its sphere of influence at the Greeks' expense, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northernTyrrhenian Seawith full ownership ofCorsica. From the first half of the 5th century BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480 BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led bySyracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474 BC, Syracuse's tyrantHierodefeated the Etruscans at theBattle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities ofLatiumand Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans andSamnites.\n\nIn the 4th century BC, Etruria saw aGallicinvasion end its influence over thePo Valleyand theAdriatic coast. Meanwhile,Romehad started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. During theRoman–Etruscan Wars, Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century BC.\n\nEtruscan League\n\n\n### Etruscan League\n\n\nAccording to legend,there was a period between 600 BC and 500 BC in which an alliance formed among 12 Etruscan settlements, known today as theEtruscan League,Etruscan Federation, orDodecapolis(Ancient Greek:Δωδεκάπολις). According to a legend, the Etruscan League of 12 cities was founded byTarchonand his brotherTyrrhenus. Tarchon lent his name to the city ofTarchna, or Tarquinnii, as it was known by the Romans. Tyrrhenus gave his name to theTyrrhenians, the alternative name for the Etruscans. Although there is no consensus on which cities were in the league, the following list may be close to the mark:Arretium,Caisra,Clevsin,Curtun,Perusna,Pupluna,Veii,Tarchna,Vetluna,Volterra,Velzna, andVelch. Some modern authors includeRusellae.The league was mostly an economic and religious league, or a loose confederation, similar to the Greek states. During the laterimperialtimes, when Etruria was just one of many regions controlled by Rome, the number of cities in the league increased by three. This is noted on many gravestones from the 2nd century BC onwards. According toLivy, the 12city-statesmet once a year at theFanum VoltumnaeatVolsinii, where a leader was chosen to represent the league.\n\nThere were two other Etruscan leagues (\"Lega dei popoli\"): that ofCampania, the main city of which wasCapua, and thePo Valleycity-states in northern Italy, which includedBologna,SpinaandAdria.\n\nPossible founding of Rome\n\n\n### Possible founding of Rome\n\n\nThose who subscribe to aLatinfoundation of Rome followed by an Etruscan invasion typically speak of an Etruscan \"influence\" on Roman culture – that is, cultural objects which were adopted by Rome from neighboring Etruria. The prevailing view is that Rome was founded by Latins who later merged with Etruscans. In this interpretation, Etruscan cultural objects are considered influences rather than part of a heritage.Rome was probably a small settlement until the arrival of the Etruscans, who constructed the first elements of its urban infrastructure such as the drainage system.\n\nThe main criterion for deciding whether an object originated at Rome and traveled by influence to the Etruscans, or descended to the Romans from the Etruscans, is date. Many, if not most, of the Etruscan cities were older than Rome. If one finds that a given feature was there first, it cannot have originated at Rome. A second criterion is the opinion of the ancient sources. These would indicate that certain institutions and customs came directly from the Etruscans. Rome is located on the edge of what was Etruscan territory. When Etruscan settlements turned up south of the border, it was presumed that the Etruscans spread there after the foundation of Rome, but the settlements are now known to have preceded Rome.\n\nEtruscan settlements were frequently built on hills—the steeper the better—and surrounded by thick walls. According toRoman mythology, whenRomulus and Remusfounded Rome, they did so on thePalatine Hillaccording to Etruscan ritual; that is, they began with apomeriumor sacred ditch. Then they proceeded to the walls. Romulus was required to kill Remus when the latter jumped over the wall, breaking its magic spell (see also underPons Sublicius). The name of Rome is attested in Etruscan in the formRuma-χmeaning 'Roman', a form that mirrors other attested ethnonyms in that language with the same suffix-χ:Velzna-χ'(someone) from Volsinii' andSveama-χ'(someone) fromSovana'. But this in itself does not prove Etruscan origin conclusively. If Tiberius is fromθefarie, then Ruma would have been placed on theThefar(Tiber) river. A heavily discussed topic among scholars is who was the founding population of Rome. In 390 BC, thecity of Rome was attackedby theGauls, and as a result may have lost many, though not all, of its earlier records.\n\nLater history relates that some Etruscans lived in theVicus Tuscus,the \"Etruscan quarter\", and that there was an Etruscan line of kings (albeit ones descended from a Greek,Demaratus of Corinth) that succeeded kings of Latin and Sabine origin. Etruscophile historians argue that this, together with evidence for institutions, religious elements and other cultural elements, proves that Rome was founded by Etruscans.\n\nUnder Romulus andNuma Pompilius, the people were said to have been divided into 30curiaeand threetribes. Few Etruscan words enteredLatin, but the names of at least two of the tribes—RamnesandLuceres—seem to be Etruscan. The last kings may have borne the Etruscan titlelucumo, while theregaliawere traditionally considered of Etruscan origin—the golden crown, the sceptre, thetoga palmata(a special robe), thesella curulis(curule chair), and above all the primary symbol of state power: thefasces. The latter was a bundle of whipping rods surrounding a double-bladed axe, carried by the king'slictors. An example of the fasces are the remains of bronze rods and the axe from a tomb in EtruscanVetulonia. This allowed archaeologists to identify the depiction of a fasces on the gravesteleof Avele Feluske, who is shown as a warrior wielding the fasces. The most telling Etruscan feature is the wordpopulus, which appears as an Etruscan deity,Fufluns.\n\nRoman families of Etruscan origin\n\n\n### Roman families of Etruscan origin\n\n\nAncharia gensArruntia gensCaecinia gensCaelia gensCaesennia gensCeionia gensCilnia gensHerminia gens–PatricianErucia gensLartia gens– PatricianPerpernia gensPersia gensRasinia gensSanquinia gensSpurinnia gensTapsennia gensTarquinia gens– Patrician (?)Tarquitia gens– PatricianUrgulania gensVerginia gens– PatricianVolumnia gens– Patrician\n\nAncharia gensArruntia gensCaecinia gensCaelia gensCaesennia gensCeionia gensCilnia gensHerminia gens–PatricianErucia gensLartia gens– PatricianPerpernia gensPersia gensRasinia gensSanquinia gensSpurinnia gensTapsennia gensTarquinia gens– Patrician (?)Tarquitia gens– PatricianUrgulania gensVerginia gens– PatricianVolumnia gens– Patrician\n\nGovernment\n\n\n### Government\n\n\nThe historical Etruscans had achieved astatesystem of society, with remnants of thechiefdomand tribal forms. Rome was in a sense the first Italic state, but it began as an Etruscan one. It is believed that the Etruscan government style changed from totalmonarchytooligarchicrepublic(as the Roman Republic) in the 6th century BC.\n\nThe government was viewed as being a central authority, ruling over all tribal and clan organizations. It retained the power of life and death; in fact, thegorgon, an ancient symbol of that power, appears as a motif in Etruscan decoration. The adherents to this state power were united by a common religion. Political unity in Etruscan society was the city-state, which was probably the referent ofmethlum, \"district\". Etruscan texts name quite a number ofmagistrates, without much of a hint as to their function: Thecamthi, theparnich, thepurth, thetamera, themacstrev, and so on. The people were themech.\n\nImportance of Religion in the Government\n\n\n#### Importance of Religion in the Government\n\n\nGovernments in ancient Mediterranean societies were explicitly interweaved with the religious practices of the contemporary. The Etruscan Kinglucomo (plural: lucumones),was considered the supreme authority and under the Etruscans’ theocratic governmental approach acted as the connection between god and people. The royal title was not just limited to hereditary succession but was also given due to elite lineage, divine sanction and also wealth. This prominence of divine sanction is reflective of the importance of religion in Etruscan governments and as such, all Etruscan kingship was also believed to be under divine approval and held the final word. Roman historian Titus Livius records the story of Lucomo which reflects how the divinity was revered and understood in the Etruscan era as captured by Roman historians. Lucomo was propelled by his wife Tanaquil to acquire power in Rome due to the inability to do so in Etruscan government,(Rome is considered the first Italic state) and on their journey an eagle replaced Lucomo's cap, which was interpreted as an omen from the divine of future kingship.\n\n“That such bird had come from such a quarter of the heavens... it had lifted the ornament placed on the head of man, to restore it to the same, by direction of the gods.”\n\nThis notion of combined political power and religious authorities held by the kingship is reinforced bySybille Haynes, an expert on Etruscology, described thelucomoto also be \"chief priest.\"Tombs of the royals found also are engraved with divine symbols, which can be interpreted to understand that kings in this society acted as a connection between humans and the spiritual.\n\nWhile there was a transition from monarchy to oligarchic democracy, religion was deeply intertwined with Etruscan political and governmental identity, as Kings and magistrates worked to ensure peace with the gods by rituals and interpretation of the divine and their will through haruspicy and augury.  Theharuspiceswere a group of pristries who by analysis of the celestial signs and animal entrails could deduce the will of the gods. The creation of city-states as Tenney Frank argued took place due to economic and natural advantages, and also due to a need for common tribal meetings in ancient polities.It allowed for a dialogue of ideas to increase communication, and desires and was headed by thezilath mechl rasnal, (“magistrate of the Etruscan people”)  who as modern scholars have argued functioned largely as a ceremonial leader, rather than a federal executive.  Modelling a decentralised theocracy, this role further ties together the idea that Entruscan government was held through shared religious rituals and beliefs.\n\nIt is important to note that while Etruscan city states such as Tarquinia and Veii were established as politically autonomous, being centered around aristocratic rule and magistrates, international composition in these states were also considered progressive by scholars and historians. It is believed often due to the abundance of Greek and Roman sources over Etruscan ones that women were not allowed participation and enjoyment in public life, however  their society was depicted to revere female gods, and women were allowed to participate in public life.This reverence for female duties can be deduced to understand how gender-diverse spirituality was also an important aspect of Etruscan society.\n\nPolitical religion also extended to the establishment of the twelve city-states, whose league was called “duodecim populi Etruriae.” This league held assemblies annually and selected theirzilath mechl rasnaat theFanun Voltumnae,the shrine ofVoltuma.Taking place at a sanctuary dedicated to the god Voltuma. These assemblies acted as both political conferences where military and peace talks could be held as well as religious festivals. Foreign policy, related to war, and alliances, were believed to be an outcome of the will of the gods, and discussions regarding this also took place at the yearly assemblies.Mario Torelliarticulates that these asemblies served the purpose of ensuing a divine sanction for the actions decided by the collective.Lastly, the importance of religion in these meetings is further emblematic by the appointment of a dictator,who was chosen based on religious rituals to then hold the same supreme authority that the King had enjoyed in early Etruscan civilisation. As such, it can be envisioned that Etruscan policy and assemblies prioritised and revered divine legitimacy, the messages from gods were treated as the ultimate authority and the government's desire to maintain a strong positive relationship is prevalent.\n\nReligion was further embedded into the urban and geographical organisations of city states, and temples became an important political feature where decisions would be made as gods would act as a tool of legitimation. Mario Torelli, an Italian scholar of the culture of Etruscans, notes the intersection of temples as a place of worship and political power, creating the ultimate intersection cultivating an environment of sacred order.\n\nEtruscan's political and governmental strategies, with their influence of religion, also left a legacy in Roman religion and statecraft. Roman annexation of Etruscan city states occurred in the 4th and 3rd century BCE, and saw the adoption of many religious-political practices. Practices such as augury and haruspicy remained especially prevalent, as Etruscan haruspices were called upon by the Roman senate reflecting the importance of religion in nation building. As much of what is known about Etruscans comes from Greek and Roman authors, due to the few written records remaining from Etruscan's, it is studied through perspectives other than their own leading to a diminished understanding of religious importance in Etruscan governance.\n\nThe princely tombs were not of individuals. The inscription evidence shows that families were interred there over long periods, marking the growth of the aristocratic family as a fixed institution, parallel to thegensat Rome and perhaps even its model. The Etruscans could have used any model of the eastern Mediterranean. That the growth of this class is related to the new acquisition of wealth through trade is unquestioned. The wealthiest cities were located near the coast. At the center of the society was the married couple,tusurthir. The Etruscans were a monogamous society that emphasized pairing.\n\nSimilarly, the behavior of some wealthy women is not uniquely Etruscan. The apparent promiscuous revelry has a spiritual explanation. Swaddling and Bonfante (among others) explain that depictions of the nude embrace, or symplegma, \"had the power to ward off evil\", as did baring the breast, which was adopted bywestern cultureas anapotropaic device, appearing finally on the figureheads of sailing ships as a nude female upper torso. It is also possible that Greek and Roman attitudes to the Etruscans were based on a misunderstanding of the place of women within their society. In both Greece and the earliest Republican Rome, respectable women were confined to the house and mixed-sex socialising did not occur. Thus, the freedom ofwomen within Etruscan societycould have been misunderstood as implying their sexual availability.A number of Etruscan tombs carry funerary inscriptions in the form \"X son of (father) and (mother)\", indicating the importance of the mother's side of the family.\n\nThe Etruscans, like the contemporary cultures ofAncient GreeceandAncient Rome, had a significant military tradition. In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals, warfare was a considerable economic advantage to Etruscan civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months, raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combatingpiracyas a means of acquiring valuable resources, such as land, prestige, goods, and slaves. It is likely that individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost. Prisoners could also potentially be sacrificed on tombs to honor fallen leaders of Etruscan society, not unlike the sacrifices made byAchillesforPatrocles.\n\n550 BC: Etruscan-Puniccoalition against Greece off the coast of Corsica540 BC:Naval victory at Alalia524 BC: Defeat atCymeagainst the Greeks510 BC: Fall of the Etruscan kingship ofLucius Tarquinius Superbusin Rome508 BC:Lars Porsenabesieges Rome508 BC: War betweenClusium and Aricia482 BC: Beginning of the conflict betweenVeiiand Rome474 BC: Defeat of the Etruscans againstSyracusein theBattle of Cyme(also Cumae)430 BC 406 BC: Defeat against theSamnitesinCampania406 BC: Siege of Veii by Rome396 BC: Destruction of Veii by Romefrom 396 BC: Invasion of the Celts into thePo Valley384 BC: Plunder ofPyrgi(Santa Severa) byDionysius I of Syracuse358 BC: Alliance ofTarquiniaandCerveteriagainst Rome310 BC: Defeat against the Romans atLake Vadimone300 BC: Pyrgi becomes a Roman colony280 BC: Defeat ofVulciagainst Rome264 BC 100 BC: Defeat ofVolsiniiagainst Rome260 BC: Subjugation by the Gauls in the Po Valley205 BC: Support ofScipioin the campaign againstHannibal183 BC: Foundation of the Roman colony inSaturnia90 BC: Granting ofRoman citizenship82 BC: Repression ofSullain Etruria79 BC: Capitulation ofVolterrafrom 40 BC: Final Romanization of Etruria\n\nThe range of Etruscan civilization is marked byits cities. They were entirely assimilated by Italic,Celtic, or Roman ethnic groups, but the names survive from inscriptions and their ruins are of aesthetic and historic interest in most of the cities of central Italy. Etruscan cities flourished over most of Italy during theRoman Iron Age, marking the farthest extent of Etruscan civilization. They were gradually assimilated first by Italics in the south, then by Celts in the north and finally in Etruria itself by the growing Roman Republic.\n\nThat many Roman cities were formerly Etruscan was well known to all the Roman authors. Some cities were founded by Etruscans in prehistoric times, and bore entirely Etruscan names. Others were colonized by Etruscans who Etruscanized the name, usuallyItalic.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n### Agriculture\n\n\nThe Etruscans were aware of the techniques ofwater accumulation and conservationin Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. They built canals and dams to irrigate the land, and drained and reclaimed swamps. The archaeological remains of this infrastructure are still evident in the maritime southwestern parts ofTuscany.\n\nVite maritatais aviticulturetechnique exploitingcompanion plantingnamed after theMaremmaregion of Italy which may be relevant toclimate change.It was developed around the area by these early predecessors of the Romans who cultivated plant as nearly as possible in their natural habitat. Thevinesfrom which wine is made are a kind oflianathat naturally intertwine with trees such as maples or willows.\n\nThe Etruscan system of belief was animmanentpolytheism; that is, all visible phenomena were considered to be a manifestation ofdivinepower and that power was subdivided intodeitiesthat acted continually on the world of man and could be dissuaded or persuaded in favor of human affairs. How to understand the will of deities, and how to behave, had been revealed to the Etruscans by two initiators,Tages, a childlike figure born from tilled land and immediately gifted with prescience, andVegoia, a female figure. Their teachings were kept in a series of sacred books. Three layers of deities are evident in the extensive Etruscan art motifs. One appears to be divinities of an indigenous nature:CathaandUsil, the sun;Tivr, the moon;Selvans, a civil god;Turan, the goddess of love;Laran, the god of war;Leinth, the goddess of death;Maris;Thalna;Turms; and the ever-popularFufluns, whose name is related in some way to the city ofPopuloniaand thepopulus Romanus, possibly, the god of the people.\n\nRuling over this pantheon of lesser deities were higher ones that seem to reflect theIndo-Europeansystem: Tin orTinia, the sky,Unihis wife (Juno), andCel, the earth goddess. In addition, some Greek and Roman gods were inspired by the Etruscan system:Aritimi(Artemis),Menrva(Minerva), Pacha (Dionysus). The Greek heroes taken fromHomeralso appear extensively in art motifs.\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n### Architecture\n\n\nRelatively little is known about the architecture of the ancient Etruscans. They adapted the native Italic styles with influence from the external appearance ofGreek architecture. In turn,ancient Roman architecturebegan with Etruscan styles, and then accepted still further Greek influence.Roman templesshow many of the same differences in form to Greek ones that Etruscan temples do, but like the Greeks, use stone, in which they closely copy Greek conventions. The houses of the wealthy were evidently often large and comfortable, but the burial chambers of tombs, often filled with grave-goods, are the nearest approach to them to survive. In the southern Etruscan area, tombs have large rock-cut chambers under atumulusin largenecropoleis, and these, together with some city walls, are the only Etruscan constructions to survive. Etruscan architecture is not generally considered as part of the body of Greco-Romanclassical architecture.\n\nArt and music\n\n\n### Art and music\n\n\nEtruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (particularly lifesize onsarcophagior temples), wall-painting andmetalworking(especially engraved bronze mirrors). Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later). In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was apparently little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, includingCarrara marble, which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans. Most surviving Etruscan art comes from tombs, including all thefrescowall-paintings, a minority of which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.\n\nBuccherowares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery. There was also a tradition of elaborateEtruscan vase painting, which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market forGreek vases. Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colorfully painted terracottaantefixesand other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished. Etruscan art was strongly connected toreligion; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.\n\nThe Etruscan musical instruments seen in frescoes and bas-reliefs are different types of pipes, such as theplagiaulos(the pipes ofPanorSyrinx), the alabaster pipe and the famous double pipes, accompanied on percussion instruments such as thetintinnabulum,tympanumandcrotales, and later by stringed instruments like thelyreandkithara.\n\nEtruscans left around 13,000inscriptionswhich have been found so far, only a small minority of which are of significant length. Attested from 700 BC to AD 50, the relation of Etruscan to other languages has been a source of long-running speculation and study. The Etruscans are believed to have spoken aPre-Indo-EuropeanandPaleo-European language,and the majority consensus is that Etruscan is related only to other members of what is called theTyrsenian language family, which in itself is anisolate family, that is unrelated directly to other known language groups. SinceRix(1998), it is widely accepted that the Tyrsenian family groupsRaeticandLemnianare related to Etruscan.\n\nLiterature\n\n\n### Literature\n\n\nEtruscan texts, written in a space of seven centuries, use a form of theGreek alphabetdue to close contact between the Etruscans and the Greek colonies atPithecusaeandCumaein the 8th century BC (until it was no longer used, at the beginning of the 1st century AD). Etruscan inscriptions disappeared fromChiusi,PerugiaandArezzoaround this time. Only a few fragments survive, religious and especially funeral texts, most of which are late (from the 4th century BC). In addition to the original texts that have survived to this day, there are a large number of quotations and allusions from classical authors. In the 1st century BC,Diodorus Siculuswrote that literary culture was one of the great achievements of the Etruscans. Little is known of it and even what is known of their language is due to the repetition of the same few words in the many inscriptions found (by way of the modern epitaphs) contrasted in bilingual or trilingual texts with Latin andPunic. Out of the aforementioned genres, is just one such Volnio (Volnius) cited in classical sources mentioned.With a few exceptions, such as theLiber Linteus, theonly written records in the Etruscan languagethat remain are inscriptions, mainly funerary. The language is written in theEtruscan alphabet, a script related to the earlyEuboean Greek alphabet.Many thousand inscriptions in Etruscan are known, mostlyepitaphs, and a fewvery short textshave survived, which are mainly religious. Etruscan imaginative literature is evidenced only in references by later Roman authors, but it is evident from their visual art that the Greek myths were well known.\n\nWith the founding ofPithekussaionIschiaand Kyme (lat.Cumae) inCampaniain the course of theGreek colonization, the Etruscans came under the influence of theGreek culturein the 8th century BC. The Etruscans adopted analphabetfrom the western Greek colonists that came from their homeland, the EuboeanChalkis. This alphabet from Cumae is therefore also called Euboeanor ChalcidianAlphabet. The oldest written records of the Etruscans date from around 700 BC.\n\nOne of the oldest Etruscan written documents is found on thetablet of Marsiliana d’Albegnafrom the hinterland ofVulci, which is now kept in theNational Archaeological MuseumofFlorence. A western Greek model alphabet is engraved on the edge of thiswax tabletmade ofivory. In accordance with later Etruscan writing habits, thelettersin this model alphabet were mirrored and arranged from right to left:\n\nThe script with these letters was first used in southern Etruria around 700 BC in the EtruscanCisra(lat.Caere), today'sCerveteri.The science of writing quickly reached central and northern Etruria. From there, the alphabet spread fromVolterra(Etr.Velathri) toFelsina, today'sBologna, and later fromChiusi(Etr.Clevsin) to the Po Valley. In southern Etruria, the writing spread fromTarquinia(Etr.Tarchna) andVeii(Etr.Veia) further south to Campania, which was controlled by the Etruscans at the time.In the following centuries the Etruscans consistently used the letters mentioned, so that thedecipheringof the Etruscan inscriptions is not a problem. As in Greek, the characters were subject to regional and temporal changes. Overall, one can distinguish an archaic script from the 7th to 5th centuries from a more recent script from the 4th to 1st centuries BC, in which some characters were no longer used, including the X for a sh sound. In addition, in writing and language, the emphasis on the first syllable meant that internal vowels were not reproduced, e.g.Menrvainstead ofMenerva.Accordingly,linguistsalso distinguish between Old and New Etruscan.\n\nAlongside thetablet of Marsiliana d’Albegna, around 70 objects with model alphabets have been preserved from the early period.The most famous of these are:\n\nAlabastronfrom theRegolini-Galassi tombin CerveteriBucchero amphora from FormelloBucchero cockerel from ViterboBuccherovessel from the necropolis of Sorbo near Cerveteri\n\nAs all four artifacts date from the 7th century B.C. come from, the alphabets are always written clockwise.The last object has the special feature that, in addition to the letters of the alphabet, almost all consonants are shown in sequence in connection with the vowels I, A, U and E (Syllabary). This syllabic writing system was probably used to practice the written characters.\n\nThe most important Etruscan written monuments that contain a large number of words include:\n\nLiber Linteus(Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis) – ritual text with around 1400 wordsClay Tablet of Capua(TabulaorTegula Capuana) – ritual text as a bustrophedon with 62 lines and around 300 wordsTablet of Cortona(Tabula Cortonensis) – contract text with a length of 32 lines and about 200 wordsCippus Perusinus– travertine block with 46 lines and about 125 words from nearPerugiaPyrgi Tablets– parallel texts in Etruscan andPunic scriptSarcophagus of Laris Pulenas– grave inscription of Laris Pulena with nine lines of text on a sarcophagus scrollLiver of Piacenza– model of a sheep's liver with 40 inscriptionsLead Plaque of Magliano– sacrificial instructions with 70 wordsLead strip from Santa Marinella– two fragments of a sacrificial vowBuilding inscription of the tomb of San Manno near Perugia – 30-word consecration inscriptionPoupé aryballos[fr]– Clockwise dedication inscription on a bucchero bottleTuscanian dice– Two dice with the numbers 1 to 6\n\nNo further Etruscan literature has survived and from the early 1st century AD, inscriptions with Etruscan characters have ceased to exist. All existing ancient Etruscan written documents are systematically collected in theCorpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum.\n\nIn the middle of the 7th century BC, the Romans adopted the Etruscan writing system and letters. In particular, they used the three different characters C, K and Q for a K sound. Z was also initially adopted into the Roman alphabet, although the affricate TS did not occur in the Latin language. Later, Z was replaced in the alphabet by the newly formed letter G, which was derived from C, and Z was finally placed at the end of the alphabet.The letters Θ, Φ and Ψ were omitted by the Romans because the corresponding aspirated sounds did not occur in their language.\n\nThe Etruscan alphabet spread across the northern and central parts of the Italian peninsula. It is assumed that the formation of theOscan script, probably in the 6th century BC, was fundamentally influenced by Etruscan. The characters of theUmbrian,FaliscanandVeneticlanguages can also be traced back to Etruscan alphabets.\n\nPart ofa serieson the\n\nEarlyPrehistoric ItalyNuragic civilization(18th–3rd c.

  "Etruscan military history": "This article includes alist of references,related reading, orexternal links,but its sources remain unclear because it lacksinline citations.Please helpimprovethis article byintroducingmore precise citations.(February 2013)(Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nTheEtruscans, like the contemporary cultures ofAncient GreeceandAncient Rome, had a persistent military tradition. In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals in Etruscan culture, warfare was a considerable economic boon to Etruscan civilization. Like manyancientsocieties, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during the summer months of the year,raidingneighboring areas, attempting to gain territory, and combatting piracy. These activities were a means of acquiring valuable resources such as land, prestige goods and slaves. It was also likely that individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at a high cost. Prisoners could also potentially be sacrificed on tombs to honor fallen leaders of Etruscan society, not unlike the sacrifices made byAchillesforPatroclus.\n\nSignificant battles\n\n\n## Significant battles\n\n\nThe written record of the Etruscans is fragmentary, but it is generally believed that the Etruscans vied with the early Romans for control of the central Italian peninsula for nearly two centuries (c. 700-500 BCE) before becoming one of the first neighboring cultures to succumb to Roman expansion.\n\nIn theBattle of Cumaein 474 BCE, the Etruscans and allies were defeated in the waters off of Cumae by the combined navies of Cumae and Syracuse. This defeat successfully blocked the southern expansion of Etruscan influence and marked the beginning of their territorial losses in southern Italy.\n\nIn theRoman–Etruscan Wars, Roman authors wrote accounts of a drawn-out siege on thecity of Veii. According to the Roces, the army of Rome unsuccessfully laid siege to the Etruscan city of Veii for 9 years before they were able to tunnel beneath the walls of the city and bring about Veii's downfall. The veracity of the account is difficult to determine, because the accounts are told as part of the biography ofMarcus Furius Camillus, a legendary figure in Roman history.LivyandPlutarchwrote about Camillus long after his death.\n\nIn addition to written sources, the archaeological record provides evidence for the Etruscan military and warfare.TombsofwealthyEtruscans consistently contain either representative sculpture ofweaponryandarmour, or the items themselves. The varieties ofshields,helms, armour and weaponry vary according to date and location, but can still be organized into broad stylistic categories.\n\nSeveral Etruscan shields have been recovered from Etruscan grave sites. The shields are traditionally decoratedbronzecircular disks measuring around a yard across. Earlier Etruscan shields are flat and later examples have a slightly convex curve across the body of the shield. The later styles bear close resemblance to contemporary Greek models. There are several helmet designs found at Etruscan sites, the most distinctively Etruscan being the so-called “crested helm” variety. The crest is fashioned by joining two embossed plates (orlaminae) into a high peak pointed crest. The high crest is frequently embossed with decoration. In addition to the Crested Helm a number of other varieties of helms have been found in Etruscan tombs. Often the design is a semi-spherical cap, with no decoration or with appliques. Another variation to the common semispherical cap is cheek guards attached by hinges.\n\nBoth swords and spears are frequently found at Etruscan tomb sites. Few examples of Etruscan swords survive in good condition, often only fragments of heavily oxidized blades. What does survive are generally robust spear points and wide blades not unlike early Roman weaponry. The bronze armour of the Etruscans is similar in style to that of the Greeks. One example fromTarquiniawas two solid pieces connected by hinges at the hips and on either side of the neck. The example was anatomical in design, meaning the bronze plates were fashioned to look like the chest and back of a robust man. Another example from theNarce Tombs, northwest of the city of Rome, was from an earlier date and decorated like the Crested Helm. The Narce Tomb breast plate evidently would have restricted the range of motion considerable more and has led to hypotheses that it was intended for a stationary commander. Anatomical greaves have also been found in Etruscan tombs.\n\nSome of what is known about the arms and armour of the Etruscans is not based on actual equipment but rather sculpted duplicates. \"TheTomb of Reliefs\" at Cerveteri is a rock-hewn tomb with relief and stucco relief work painted to look as if the dead would be provided with all necessary goods to live comfortably in the tomb. This tomb provides a great deal of beneficial insight to the several types of Etruscan material culture including weapons. Among the decorations were a number of life sized weapons, items of armour and shields.\n\nReferences and further reading\n\n\n## References and further reading\n\n\nB.

As the Etruscan civilization was gradually assimilated into theRoman Republicfrom the 4th century BC, the Etruscanreligionandmythologywere partially incorporated intoancient Roman culture, following the Roman tendency to absorb some of the local gods and customs of conquered lands. The first attestations of an Etruscan religion can be traced back to theVillanovan culture.\n\nGreek influence\n\n\n### Greek influence\n\n\nGreek traders brought their religion and hero figures with them to the coastal areas of the central Mediterranean.Odysseus,MenelausandDiomedesfrom theHomerictradition were recast in tales of the distant past that had them roaming the lands West of Greece. In Greek tradition,Heracleswandered these western areas, doing away with monsters and brigands, and bringing civilization to the inhabitants. Legends of his prowess with women became the source of tales about his many offspring conceived with prominent local women, though his role as a wanderer meant that Heracles moved on after securing the locations chosen to be settled by his followers, rather than fulfilling a typical founder role. Over time, Odysseus also assumed a similar role for the Etruscans as the heroic leader who led the Etruscans to settle the lands they inhabited.\n\nClaims that the sons of Odysseus had once ruled over the Etruscan people date to at least the mid-6th century BC.LycophronandTheopompuslink Odysseus toCortona(where he was calledNanos).In Italy during this era it could give non-Greek ethnic groups an advantage over rival ethnic groups to link their origins to a Greek hero figure. These legendary heroic figures became instrumental in establishing the legitimacy of Greek claims to the newly settled lands, depicting the Greek presence there as reaching back into antiquity.\n\nRoman conquest\n\n\n### Roman conquest\n\n\nThe mythology is evidenced by a number of sources in different media, for example representations on large numbers of pottery items, inscriptions and engraved scenes on the Praenestinecistae(ornate boxes; see underEtruscan language) and onspecula(ornate hand mirrors). Currently some two dozen fascicles of theCorpus Speculorum Etruscorumhave been published. Specifically Etruscan mythological and cult figures appear in theLexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae.Etruscan inscriptions have recently been given a more authoritative presentation byHelmut Rix,Etruskische Texte.\n\nSeers and divinations\n\n\n## Seers and divinations\n\n\nThe Etruscans believed their religion had beenrevealedto them by seers,the two main ones beingTages, a childlike figure born from tilled land who was immediately gifted withprescience, andVegoia, a female figure.\n\nThe Etruscans believed in intimate contact with divinity.They did nothing without proper consultation with the gods andsignsfrom them.These practices were taken over in total by the Romans.\n\nEtrusca Disciplina\n\n\n### Etrusca Disciplina\n\n\nThe Etruscanscriptureswere a corpus of texts termed theEtrusca Disciplina. This name appears inValerius Maximus,andMarcus Tullius Cicerorefers to adisciplinain his writings on the subject.\n\nMassimo Pallottinosummarizes the scriptures known from other sources to have once existed. The revelations of the prophetTages(Libri Tagetici, \"Tagetic Books\") included the theory and rules ofdivinationfrom animalentrails(Libri Haruspicini, \"HaruspicalBooks\") and discussion of the Etruscan afterlife and its attendant rituals (Libri Acherontici, \"AcheronticBooks\"). The revelations of the prophetessVegoia(Libri Vegoici, \"Vegoic Books\") included the theory and rules of divination from thunder (brontoscopy) and lightning strikes (Libri Fulgurales, \"FulguralBooks\") and discussion of religious rituals. Books on rituals (Libri Rituales) included Tages's Acherontic Books as well as other books on omens and prodigies (Libri Ostentaria) and books on fate (Libri Fatales) that detailed the religiously proper ways to found cities, erect shrines, drain fields, formulate laws, and measure space and time.\n\nThe Etrusca Disciplina was mainly a set of rules for the conduct of all sorts of divination; Pallottino calls it a religious and political \"constitution\": it does not dictate what laws shall be made or how humans are to behave, but rather elaborates rules for asking the gods these questions and receiving answers.\n\nPriests and officials\n\n\n### Priests and officials\n\n\nDivinatory inquiries according to discipline were conducted by priests whom the Romans calledharuspicesor sacerdotes;Tarquiniihad a college of 60 of them.The Etruscans, as evidenced by the inscriptions, used several words:capen(Sabinecupencus),maru(Umbrianmaron-),eisnev,hatrencu(priestess). They called the art of haruspicyziχ neθsrac.\n\nLong after the assimilation of the Etruscans,Seneca the Youngersaidthat the difference between the Romans and the Etruscans was that\n\nWhereas we believe lightning to be released as a result of the collision of clouds, they believe that the clouds collide so as to release lightning: for as they attribute all to deity, they are led to believe not that things have a meaning insofar as they occur, but rather that they occur because they must have a meaning.\n\nSpirits and deities\n\n\n### Spirits and deities\n\n\nA god was called anais(latereis), which in the plural isaisar/eisar. TheLiber Linteus(column 5, lines 9–10, and elsewhere) seems to distinguish \"Gods of Light\"aiser sifrom \"Gods of Darkness\"aiser seu:nunθene eiser śic śeuc /unuχ mlaχ nunθen χiś esviśc faśe: \"Make an offering for both the Gods of Light and of Dark, / for them make an appropriate offering with oil from the Chi and from the Esvi rituals.\"The abode of a god was afanuorluth, a sacred place, such as afavi, a grave or temple. There, one would need to make afler(pluralflerchva), or \"offering\".\n\nThree layers of deities are portrayed in Etruscan art. One appears to be divinities of an indigenous origin:Voltumna or Vertumnus, a primordial,chthonicgod;Usil, god(-dess) of the sun;Tivr, god of the moon;Turan, goddess of love;Laran, god of war;Maris, goddess of (child-)birth;Leinth, goddess of death;Selvans, god of the woods;Thalna, goddess (or god) of fertility and childbirth;Turms,  god of trade and messenger of the gods;Fufluns, god of wine; the heroic figureHercle; and a number of underworld deities such asCatha,Lur, Suri, Thanr and Calus (all listed on theLead Plaque of Maglianoand elsewhere.)\n\nRuling over them were higher deities that seem to reflect theIndo-Europeansystem: Tin orTinia, the sky,Unihis wife (Juno),Nethuns, god of the waters, andCel, the earth goddess.\n\nAs a third layer, the Greek gods and heroes were adopted by the Etruscan system during the Etruscan Orientalizing Period of 750/700–600 BC.Examples areAritimi(Artemis),Menrva(Minerva, Latin equivalent ofAthena), the heroic figureHercle(Hercules), and Pacha (Bacchus; Latin equivalent ofDionysus), and over time the primary trinity becameTinia,UniandMenrva. This triad of gods were venerated in Tripartite temples similar to the later RomanTemple of Jupiter Capitolinus.\n\nA fourth group, the so-calleddii involutior \"veiled gods\", are sometimes mentioned as superior to all the other deities, but these were never worshipped, named, or depicted directly.\n\nEtruscan beliefs concerning the hereafter appear to be an amalgam of influences. The Etruscans shared general early Mediterranean beliefs, such as theEgyptianbelief that survival and prosperity in the hereafter depend on the treatment of the deceased's remains.Etruscan tombs imitated domestic structures and were characterized by spacious chambers, wall paintings and grave furniture. In the tomb, especially on the sarcophagus (examples shown below), was a representation of the deceased in his or her prime, often with a spouse. Not everyone had a sarcophagus; sometimes the deceased was laid out on a stone bench. As the Etruscans practiced mixed inhumation and cremation rites (the proportion depending on the period), cremated ashes and bones might be put into an urn in the shapes of a house or a representation of the deceased.\n\nFunerary home atBanditacciawith couchesFunerary home atPopuloniaSarcophagus fromSienaSarcophagus fromChiusiSarcophagusBurial urnUrn fromChiusi\n\nWomen in Etruscan religion\n\n\n## Women in Etruscan religion\n\n\nWomen in Ancient Etruria enjoyed more social liberties than their Roman counterparts until the Roman absorption of Etruria and the consequential assimilation into it. For example, the husband and wife often stood alongside each other in representations, and women were portrayed on sarcophagi in the same ceremonial feasts that men were.Etruscan women also participated in an array of religious activities, which can be observed through archaeological evidence of votive offerings, ceremonial textile production, and iconography found in Etruscan burials.\n\nVotive evidence for Etruscan worship is rich and provides insight into how women worshipped deities in Etruria. Women'svotive offeringsincluded terracotta or bronze statuettes, items related to textile production, such as spindle whorls or spools, or anatomical votives.\n\nAn inscribed bronze statue base dating to the Archaic period (525-500 BCE) was excavated at Campo della Fiera inOrvieto, Italy, and provides evidence of an affluent woman's offering to a deity. The statue's inscription reads that it is a dedication to a deity, or  group of deities, named- Tlusχval, from Kanuta, who may be a freedwoman based on the inscription's use of the nounlauteniθa, although it is hard to say for certain.This inscription confirms that affluent Etruscan women were able to dedicate votives at religious sites freely, showcasing their wealth and testifying towomen's social freedoms in ancient Etruria. Etruscan sanctuaries also reveal evidence for the dedication of anatomical votives. Models of body parts such as the uterus were often offered to divinities, likely in relation to concerns revolving around childbirth and fertility.\n\nSome scholars suggest there was a link between women's production of textiles/ceremonial textiles and ritual at Etruscan sanctuaries.Recent excavations at thePoggio Collaarchaeological site nearVicchio, Italy have revealed what may be a link between the location of excavatedspindle whorls, spools, and ritual activity due to their location. The artifacts were found on the northern sides of the acropolis, near where defensive walls were later built. Scholars have speculated that this may be due to a form of obliteration in which the artifacts were linked to their deposition in a sacred way.\n\nPriestesses\n\n\n### Priestesses\n\n\nIn speculation on the existence of an Etruscan priestess, thehatrencuis the most widely discussed term in scholarly communities. The termhatrencuwas found in the inscriptions from a tomb inVulci, a formerly Etruscan town in central Italy.\n\nThe tomb is especially significant in that it contains a group of women buried together, which deviates from normal Etruscan burial rituals of men and women. The status of thehatrencuas an Etruscan priestess is widely debated by scholars. While many scholars assert that due to the abnormal burial conditions and the obscure term usage in the inscription, thehatrencurepresents a priestess, other scholars disagree with these conclusions.There is also debate on whether the iconography of the tombs points to the women buried being associated with ritual objects, with acistain the tomb of a woman named Ramtha as an example, however the female depictions could just as easily be divinities associated with funerary culture.\n\nThe role of thehatrencuis thought to be similar to that of the Roman college of matrons, which was dedicated to the worship of the goddessMater Matuta. Such a comparison underscores the possible ritual and social functions that hatrencu may have held in Etruscan society.Whether there were female religious specialists such as Etruscan priestess in Etruria, is mainly speculation and is subject to ongoing academic debate.\n\nInterpretatio graecaList of Etruscan mythological figuresList of Etruscan names for Greek heroesLiber LinteusDaily life of the Etruscans\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBonfante, Giuliano;Bonfante, Larissa(2002).The Etruscan Language: an Introduction.

  "Etruscan society": "Etruscan societyis mainly known through the memorial and achievemental inscriptions on monuments ofEtruscan civilization, especially tombs. This information emphasizes family data. Some contractual information is also available from various sources.The Roman and Greek historians had more to say of Etruscan government.\n\nAristocratic families\n\n\n## Aristocratic families\n\n\nSociety of the tombs\n\n\n### Society of the tombs\n\n\nThe population described by the inscriptions owned the tombs in which their relatives interred them and were interred in turn. These were the work of craftsmen who must have gone to considerable expense, for which they must have been paid. The interment chambers also were stocked with furniture, luxury items and jewelry, which are unlikely to have been available to the ordinary citizen. The sarcophagi were ornate, each one a work of art. The society of the tombs therefore was that of the aristocrats. While alive they occupied magistracies recorded in the inscriptions. Their magisterial functions are obscure now, but they were chief men in society.\n\nThe Etruscans did not always own sufficient wealth to supportnecropolisesfor their chief men and stock them with expensive items to be smashed and thrown away. People of theVillanovan culturelived in poor huts concomitant with subsistence agriculture and owned plain and simple implements. Their simple ware is known asbucchero, plain black undecorated pots. In the 8th century BC, theorientalizing periodbegan, a time of influx of luxuriously living Greeks. They brought their elegant pottery styles and architectural methods with them.\n\nYet the rise of Etruscan civilization cannot entirely be explained by immigrants from Greece. The Etruscans became a maritime power. By the 7th century they had imported methods and materials from the eastern Mediterranean and were leaving written inscriptions. Groups of Villanovan villages were now consolidated intoEtruscan cities. Elaborate tomb cities began to appear.\n\nRise of the family\n\n\n### Rise of the family\n\n\nThe princely tombs were not of individuals. The inscriptional evidence shows that families were interred there over long periods, marking the growth of the aristocratic family as a fixed institution, parallel to thegensatRomeand perhaps even its model. It is not an Etruscan original, as there is no sign of it in theVillanovan. The Etruscans could have used any model of the eastern Mediterranean. That the growth of this class is related to the new acquisition of wealth through trade is unquestioned. The wealthiest cities were located near the coast.\n\nThe Etruscan name of the family waslautn.At the center of thelautnwas the married couple,tusurthir. The Etruscans were a monogamous society that emphasized pairing. The lids of large numbers of sarcophagi (for example, the \"Sarcophagus of the Spouses\") are adorned with sculpted couples, smiling, in the prime of life (even if the remains were of persons advanced in age), reclining next to each other or with arms around each other. The bond was obviously a close one by social preference.\n\nIt is possible that Greek and Roman attitudes to the Etruscans were based on a misunderstanding of the place of women within their society. In both Greece and Republican Rome, respectable women were mostly confined to the house and mixed-sex socialising did not occur. Thus the freedom of women within Etruscan society could have been misunderstood as implying their sexual availability.\n\nA number of Etruscan tombs carry funerary inscriptions in the form 'X son of [father] and [mother]', indicating the importance of the mother's side of the family.\n\nDevelopment of names\n\n\n### Development of names\n\n\nEtruscan naming conventions are complex and appear to reveal different stages in the development of names.The stages apply only to aristocratic names, attested in the inscriptions. Whether the ordinary people followed suit or were perhaps in the earliest stage remains unknown.\n\nEveryone at all times had apraenomen, or first name, which was a simple descendant of an ancient name, or a compound comprising a meaningful expression.They were marked for gender:aule/aulia, larth/lartha, arnth/arntia. There is no evidence that girls were named for males, as in Roman society; that is, a girl did not take her father's or husband's name. Some names were entirely female.\n\nPatronymic and matronymic\n\n\n#### Patronymic and matronymic\n\n\nAs inProto-Indo-European, individual males were further distinguished by apatronymic, which could be formed in a few different ways:\n\nthegenitive case:larth arnthal, \"Larth son of Arnth.\"the genitive case withclan, \"son\":larth clan arnthal.thenominative caseformed from the genitive with a patronymic suffix:-isa, -sa, -sla, whichGiulianoandLarissa Bonfanteregard as a suffixeddemonstrative pronoun:arnth larthal-isa.\n\nFemales were further identified with either the husband's name (gamonymic) or the son's name in patronymic construction. Unlike the Indo-Europeans, the girls had a matronymic, same construction. Sometimes males are identified with a matronymic, thus leaving some doubt as to whether early Etruscan society waspatrilinear. The men were perhaps dominant (patriarchy); there was a word for \"wife\",puia, which ties a woman to her husband conceptually, but none for husband.  These names and conventions must have prevailed in theVillanovan culture.\n\nNomen gentile\n\n\n#### Nomen gentile\n\n\nThenomen gentile, or family name, dates to theorientalizing period. Recorded names are minimally binomial:Vethur Hathisna, Avile Repesuna, Fasti Aneina. Patronyms and other further specifications are added after it:Arnth Velimna Aules, \"Arnth Velimna son of Aule.\" In those contexts double patronymics can be used, naming the father and grandfather:Arnth Velimna Aules clan Larthalisla, \"Arnth Velimna son of Aule son of Larth.\"\n\nThe nomen gentile was formed in a number of ways, most often with a-nasuffix,-nasin south Etruscan (possibly thegenitive case). The suffixed nomen might refer to an individual of the family:Arnth/Arnth-na, spure/spuri-na; or it might be a mythological figure:usil/usel-na; or a geographic location:Velch/Vels-na.\n\nThe nomen gentile was anadjectiveand could be used alone as a noun, the name in this case, as though it were apraenomen. In that case male and female forms appear, perhaps the closest linguistic feature to agreement of gender: a male would be in thevipinafamily, named after a previous individual,Vipi, but a female in theVipinei, or a male in theVelthina, named afterVel, and a female in theVeliana. The male and female names refer to the same family.\n\nProbably in deference toItalic, the nomen gentile could also be formed with-iefor males or-iand-afor females, perhaps from Italic-iosor its later form-ius, which can be made feminine:-ia.Typically of Etruscanboth suffices can be used together:-na-ie.\n\nThe serious study of nomina gentilia is just beginning, due to the accumulation of sufficient names on which to base hypotheses. A family might be concentrated at one location or appear in a number of cities, and be spelled in as many as a dozen different ways. The Romans themselves identified a good many gentes at Rome that were originally Etruscan and since then scholars have spotted more. It is not unlikely that much of thepatricianclass, which was most powerful under the Etruscan kings, was derived from or was an Etruscan model, which dated to no earlier than the 8th century BC.\n\nKinship among the Etruscans was vertical, or generational. They kept track of six generations. In addition to themi(“I”) an individual recognized aclan(“son”) or asec(“daughter”), aneftś'(“grandson”), and aprumaths(“great-grandson”). Every self had anapaandati(“father” and “mother”) and relatives older than they.\n\nA division of relatives as maternal or paternal seems to have existed: theapa nachnaand theati nachna, the grandfather’s and grandmother’s relatives. On the level of the self, the lack of any words for aunt, uncle or cousins is notable. Very likely,apawas a generational word: it meant father or any of father’s male relatives. Similarly,atiwould have meant any female relative of mother’s age or generation.Ruva(“brother”) is recognized, but no sister. It is possible, though hard to determine, thatruvahad a broader meaning of \"any related male of the self’s generation\".\n\nThis horizontal telescoping of relatives applies indirectly to the self as well. Thetelalsare the grand offspring, either male or female, of the grandmother, and thepapalsof the grandfather. It is difficult to determine whetherneftśmeans \"grandson\" or \"nephew\" although there could be cross-cultural contamination here with Latinnepōs(< IE*nepōts) which derives from a kinship system anthropologists call theOmaha type. In the Omaha type, the same word is used for both nephew and grandson but this kinship type does not typically exhibit terminology used for \"kin of a particular generation\" as suspected in Etruscan kinship terms.\n\nThe Etruscans were careful also to distinguish status within the family. There was a stepdaughter and stepson,sech farthanaandclan thuncultha(although this may in fact mean \"first son\" based on the rootthun-\"one\"), as well as a stepmother,ativu(literally \"little mother\"), an adopted son,clanti, and the universal mother-in-law,netei. Other terms were not as high or democratic in status. The system was like that of the Roman. Theeterawere slaves, or more precisely, foreign slaves. When they had been freed they werelautni(male) orlautnitha(female), freed men or women, who were closely connected to the family and were clients of it in return for service and respect.\n\nGovernment\n\n\n## Government\n\n\nThis sectiondoes notciteanysources.Please helpimprove this sectionbyadding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged andremoved.(March 2016)(Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nThe historical Etruscans had achieved astatesystem of society, with remnants of thechiefdomandtribalforms. In this they were ahead of the surroundingItalics, who still hadchiefsandtribes.  It is believed that the Etruscan government style changed from totalmonarchytooligarchicdemocracy(as theRoman Republic) in the 6th century BC. It is important to note this did not happen to all the city states.\n\nThe Etruscan state government was essentially atheocracy. The government was viewed as being a central authority, over all tribal and clan organizations. It retained the power of life and death; in fact, thegorgon, an ancient symbol of that power, appears as a motif in Etruscan decoration. The adherents to this state power were united by a common religion. Political unity in Etruscan society was the city-state, which was probably the referent ofmethlum, “district”. Etruscan texts name quite a number ofmagistrates, without much of a hint as to their function: thecamthi, theparnich, thepurth, thetamera, themacstrev, and so on. The people were themech. Initially themethlumwere ruled by kings, known aslucumons(the infinitive of verb \"to rule\" islucair). These kings were associated with the use offascesand other regal insignia. Thelucumonswere later replaced by annual magistrates known aszilath.\n\nAll the city-states of the Etruscans were gathered into confederacies, or “leagues”. The sources tell us there were three. A league for unknown reasons, likely religious, had to include 12 city-states. The word for league wasmech rasnal. Once a year the states met at afanu, or sacred place (Latinfanum) to discuss military and political affairs, and also to choose a head of confederation,zilath mechl rasnal, who held the office for one year. The Etrurian confederacy met at thefanum Voltumnae, the \"shrine of Voltumna\". Their league was called the “duodecim populi Etruriae” or the “twelve peoples of Etruria”. In the case of danger the league could appoint adictator(macstrna/mastarna) to lead them, a practice that was later copied by the Romans.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and the Etruscans was not one of an outsider conquering a foreign people. The Etruscans considered Rome as one of their cities, perhaps originally in the Latian/Campanian league. It is entirely possible that theTarquinsappealed toLars PorsenaofClusium(Clevsin), because he was the head of the Etrurian commonwealth for that year. He would have been obliged to help the Tarquins whether he liked it or not.\n\nThe Romans attacked and annexed individual cities between 510 and 290 BC. This apparent disunity of the Etruscans was probably regarded as internal dissent by the Etruscans themselves. For example, after the sack of Rome by theGauls, the Romans debated whether to move the city en masse toVeii, which they could not even have considered if Veii was thought to be a foreign people. Eventually Rome created treaties individually with the Etruscan states, rather than the whole. But by that time the league had fallen into disuse, due to the permanent hegemony of Rome and increasing assimilation of Etruscan civilization to it, which was a natural outcome, as Roman civilization was to a large degree Etruscan.\n\nRoman naming conventionsEtruscan civilizationDaily life of the Etruscans\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBonfante, G.;L.

  "Fufluns": "InEtruscan religion,Fufluns(Etruscan:𐌚𐌖𐌚𐌋𐌖𐌍𐌔) orPuphluns(Etruscan:𐌐𐌖𐌘𐌋𐌖𐌍𐌔) was a god of plant life, happiness, wine, health, and growth in all things. He is mentioned twice among the gods listed in the inscriptions of theLiver of Piacenza, being listed among the 16gods that rule the Etruscan astrological houses. He is the 9th of those 16gods.He is the son ofSemlaand the godTinia. He was worshipped atPopulonia(EtruscanFuflunaorPupluna) and is the namesake of that town.\n\nHis Greek equivalent isDionysos(Latin Dionysus), whereas his Roman equivalent isLiber. For this reason he was also called Fufluns Pachies or Pacha.He was adopted by the Romans but was quickly meshed with Dionysus and his rituals were changed heavily by the influence of Dionysian frenzies.\n\nIconography\n\n\n## Iconography\n\n\nFufluns is usually depicted as a beardless youth, but is sometimes rarely shown as an older, bearded man. Fufluns was shown in art with thethyrsus,satyrs,maenads, and otherapotropaic symbols.\n\nFufluns is associated with several other deities in art, includingApulu(Apollo) who is considered his brother and his mother Semla.In association with them, Fufluns was sometimes seen as achthonicdeity associated with the underworld and apsychopompthat guided and protected souls.Fufluns was additionally associated with a purely Etruscan goddess named Catha.\n\nFufluns shares many myths with Dionysus, including the story of his birth, which parallels the story ofZeusand Semele.Like that myth, the pregnant Semla is killed by Tinia in the form of a lightning bolt, who then continues to bear Fufluns by sewing the infant into his thigh and later giving birth to him.However, Semla continues to appear in artwork in association with an adult Fufluns after her death, indicating either a resurrection or immortalization of his mother.\n\nAdditionally, Fufluns's connection to his mother is sometimes cast as romantic, as seen in artwork that shows them in an embrace used elsewhere in Etruscan artwork to indicate erotic entanglement.\n\nAnother depiction of a lost myth regarding Fufluns depicts his relationship with Areatha, the Etruscan form ofAriadne. The bronze mirror shows Fufluns and Areatha but also includes additional figures that are not part of the Greek version of the myth, namely Castur (the EtruscanCastor), a male figure called Eiasun (Jason) and a small winged figure identified as Aminth, who is attributed as the personification of love.The implications of the scene are based on a myth that is no longer recorded, but indicate some disagreement between Eiasun and Fufluns in which Areatha is involved.The myth of Fuflun and Areatha itself follows the traditional Greek myth, in which Areatha is abandoned byTheseusafter helping him escape the labyrinth of Minos. Fufluns then finds Areatha and falls in love with her, and they later marry.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBonfante, Larissa, andJudith Swaddling. (2006).Etruscan Myths.

It must have been a case of East-West understanding on a relatively high, technical level. The mobility of migrant charismatics is the natural prerequisite for this diffusion, the international role of sought-after specialists, who were, as far as their art was concerned, nevertheless bound to their father-teachers. We cannot expect to find many archaeologically identifiable traces of such people, other than some exceptional instances.\n\n—Walter Burkert, 1992.The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age(Thames and Hudson), p. 51.\n\n—Walter Burkert, 1992.The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age(Thames and Hudson), p. 51.\n\nThe Babylonians were famous for hepatoscopy. This practice is mentioned in theBook of Ezekiel21:21:\n\nFor the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; heshaketh the arrowsto and fro, he inquireth of theteraphim, he looketh in the liver.\n\nOne Babylonian clay model of a sheep's liver, dated between 1900 and 1600 BCE, is conserved in theBritish Museum.\n\nThe Assyro-Babylonian tradition was also adopted inHittite religion. At least thirty-six liver-models have been excavated atHattusa. Of these, the majority are inscribed in Akkadian,  but a few examples also have inscriptions in the nativeHittite language, indicating the adoption of haruspicy as part of the native, vernacular cult.\n\nAncient Italy\n\n\n## Ancient Italy\n\n\nRoman haruspicy was a form of communication with the gods. Rather than strictly predicting future events, this form of Roman divination allowed humans to discern the attitudes of the gods and react in a way that would maintain harmony between the human and divine worlds (pax deorum).Before taking important actions, especially in battle, Romans conducted animal sacrifices to discover the will of the gods according to the information gathered through reading the animals' entrails.The entrails (most importantly the liver, but also the lungs and heart) contained a large number of signs that indicated the gods' approval or disapproval. These signs could be interpreted according to the appearance of the organs, for example, if the liver was \"smooth, shiny and full\" or \"rough and shrunken\".The Etruscans looked for thecaput iocineris, or \"head of the liver\". It was considered a bad omen if this part was missing from the animal's liver. The haruspex would then study the flat visceral side of the liver after examining thecaput iocineris.\n\nHaruspicy in Ancient Italy originated with the Etruscans. Textual evidence for Etruscan divination comes from an Etruscan inscription: the priest Laris Pulenas' (250–200 BCE) epitaph mentions a book he wrote on haruspicy.

The Greek ἡπατοσκοπίαhēpatoskōpiais fromhēpar= \"liver\" andskop-= \"to examine\".\n\nAncient Near East\n\n\n## Ancient Near East\n\n\nThe spread of hepatoscopy is one of the clearest examples of cultural contact in the orientalizing period. It must have been a case of East-West understanding on a relatively high, technical level. The mobility of migrant charismatics is the natural prerequisite for this diffusion, the international role of sought-after specialists, who were, as far as their art was concerned, nevertheless bound to their father-teachers. We cannot expect to find many archaeologically identifiable traces of such people, other than some exceptional instances.\n\n—Walter Burkert, 1992.The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age(Thames and Hudson), p. 51.\n\n—Walter Burkert, 1992.The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age(Thames and Hudson), p. 51.\n\nThe Babylonians were famous for hepatoscopy. This practice is mentioned in theBook of Ezekiel21:21:\n\nFor the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; heshaketh the arrowsto and fro, he inquireth of theteraphim, he looketh in the liver.\n\nOne Babylonian clay model of a sheep's liver, dated between 1900 and 1600 BCE, is conserved in theBritish Museum.\n\nThe Assyro-Babylonian tradition was also adopted inHittite religion. At least thirty-six liver-models have been excavated atHattusa. Of these, the majority are inscribed in Akkadian,  but a few examples also have inscriptions in the nativeHittite language, indicating the adoption of haruspicy as part of the native, vernacular cult.\n\nAncient Italy\n\n\n## Ancient Italy\n\n\nRoman haruspicy was a form of communication with the gods. Rather than strictly predicting future events, this form of Roman divination allowed humans to discern the attitudes of the gods and react in a way that would maintain harmony between the human and divine worlds (pax deorum).Before taking important actions, especially in battle, Romans conducted animal sacrifices to discover the will of the gods according to the information gathered through reading the animals' entrails.The entrails (most importantly the liver, but also the lungs and heart) contained a large number of signs that indicated the gods' approval or disapproval. These signs could be interpreted according to the appearance of the organs, for example, if the liver was \"smooth, shiny and full\" or \"rough and shrunken\".The Etruscans looked for thecaput iocineris, or \"head of the liver\". It was considered a bad omen if this part was missing from the animal's liver. The haruspex would then study the flat visceral side of the liver after examining thecaput iocineris.\n\nHaruspicy in Ancient Italy originated with the Etruscans. Textual evidence for Etruscan divination comes from an Etruscan inscription: the priest Laris Pulenas' (250–200 BCE) epitaph mentions a book he wrote on haruspicy. A collection of sacred texts called theEtrusca disciplina, written in Etruscan, were essentially guides on different forms of divination, including haruspicy andaugury.In addition, a number of archeological artifacts depict Etruscan haruspicy. These include a bronze mirror with an image of a haruspex dressed in Etruscan priest's clothing, holding a liver while a crowd gathers near him. Another significant artifact relating to haruspicy in Ancient Italy is thePiacenza Liver. This bronze model of a sheep's liver was found by chance by a farmer in 1877. Names of gods are etched into the surface and organized into different sections.Artifacts depicting haruspicy exist from the ancient Roman world as well, such as stone relief carvings located inTrajan's Forum.\n\nAt the most influential time of haruspicy, the Roman senate decreed that 'a certain number of young Etruscans' should be instructed in it to provide haruspices for the state.These Etruscans were later appointed as Romanaugurs.\n\nIn later days when haruspicy became a neglected art,Emperor Claudius, who ruled from AD 41-54 attempted to revive it.

  "Hercle": "InEtruscan religion,Hercle(alsoHeracleorHercl), the son ofTiniaandUni, was a version of the GreekHeracles, depicted as a muscular figure often carrying a club and wearing a lionskin. He is a popular subject inEtruscan art, particularlybronze mirrors, which show him engaged in adventures not known from theGreek mythsofHeraclesor theRomanand laterclassical mythsofHercules.\n\nIn the Etruscan tradition,Uni(RomanJuno) grants Hercle access to a life among the immortals by offering her breast milk to him.Hercle was the first man elevated to a godhood through his deeds and Etruscan aristocrats tried to identify with this ascension, as reflected in artwork and literature.\n\nHercle differed in many aspects from the GreekHeracles.He seems to have enjoyed a special status in Italy in general.In art, he is shown to be a defender of an unknown goddess against creatures on the other side of a human border, showing his status as aLiminal deity.In Etruria, he was also associated with running water.He was also the master of animals, the protector of flocks and herds, and of herdsmen.\n\nHercle was more of anoraculargod in Etruria than in Greece.Several inscriptions have come to light from 1970 that show evidence of cult worship.Particularly, a sanctuary at Caere preserved many inscriptions of dedications to the god.In Toledo, a bronze weight and an attic red-figured cup created by Euphronios testify an important cult to Hercle.\n\nScenes from Etruscan art\n\n\n## Scenes from Etruscan art\n\n\nHercle can be recognized in Etruscan art from his attributes, or is sometimes identified by name.

  "Lead Plaque of Magliano": "TheLead Plaque of Magliano(or Lead Plate of Magliano or Lead Disk;CIE5237), which contains 73 words in theEtruscan language, seems to be a dedicatory text, including as it does many names of mostly underworlddeities.It was found in 1882, and dates to the mid 5th century BC.It is now housed in the National Archaeological Museum in Florence.\n\nDescription\n\n\n## Description\n\n\nThe plaque weighs 191 grams and is curved in the shape of a lens. Its diameter is 7 cm at its narrowest point and 8 cm at its widest point. Only a few written monuments of Etruscan have survived on metal plates. The arrangement of the text is just as unusual as the shape and texture of the disk. The slab is inscribed with spiral Etruscan letters on both sides, reminiscent of thePhaistos Disc. The creation of the artifact is dated to around 450 BC. The lead plate was found in February 1882 in a field 2 km southeast ofMaglianoin theAlbegnariver valley, near the former monastery of Santa Maria in Borraccia.\n\nThe text seems to be a series of dedications to various gods and ancestors (in bold below): Cautha, \"the gods of this place,\"Maris Menita(\"Maris the Maker\"), and \"the ancestors\" (af-r-or \"forefathers\" <ap\"father\") on side A;ThanrandCalus,Śuri,Tininthe area ofLur, and (?) in the area of Lur, on side B. Other information includes where the dedications (sacrifices? offerings?) are to take place (casthia, lac, fal-za, chim\"the place of offering (or of slaughter),\"leśca; all in locative-th(-i)), how often (avil-s\"annually\" on side A, \"every four years\"? on side B), with what (musl= \"honey wine\"? andthu-n\"firstling\"? also on side B), who is to perform them (\"priest\"cepen\"of the village of the year\"tuthiu avils--so \"annually appointed village priest\"), and on whose behalf (\"for the deceased of the Murina [family],\" \"for/on behalf of the beloved ancestors\"afrs . naces—on side A; \"on behalf oftnuca\"?, \"for [honoring] the deceased\" (nesl)--on side B). Much of the rest is obscure, with the main verb \"dedicate\" apparently regularly elided.\n\nWith over 70 individual words, the text differs significantly from the thousands of short Etruscan grave inscriptions. It is among the longest in the Etruscan language. The text is written on both sides (referred to here as side A and side B), from right to left, as is usual in Etruscan texts. The text is also unusual in that it spirals inward, to be read clockwise from the outside to the inside. Most words are separated by a period.\n\ncauthas. tuthiu . avils /LXXX/ ez . chimthm . casthialth . lacth . hevn . avil . neśl . man . murinaśie . falzathi ⁝aiseras. in . ecs . mene . mlacthe marni . tuthi . tiu .  chimthm . casthialth . lacth ⁝mariśl menitla . afrs. cialath . chimth . avilsch . eca . cepen . tuthiu . thuch . ichutevr . heśni . mulveni . eth . zuci . am . ar\n\nmlach thanra calusc. ecnia . iv avil . mi menicac . marca lurcac . eth . tuthiu . nesl .man . rivach . leścem . tnucasi .śuris. eis teis . evi tiuras . mulsle mlach ilachetins . lursth. tev huvi thunlursthsas afrs . naces\n\nPartial translation\n\n\n## Partial translation\n\n\nFrom van der Meer, except where noted.\n\nFor Cautha, the annually [appointed] village [priest will dedicate] 80ez.In addition, [dedications must be made] in the place of offering (chim-th-according to Rix;van der Meer translates \"slaughtering place\"; or \"at the altar\"?),  at [the stream]Casthia, [where it empties] into the lake, [during]Hev-[period] annually.

There, it also seems to be a place for an offering (nuthe-ri) that must be made, and where gifts (turxais) are brought (eschathce). The meaning van der Meer gives forlach-there is \"basin.\" The form with a -u- stem strongly suggests connection with Italic *laku- \"basin; lake,\" so it may be the latter meaning that applies here, as van der Meer suggests, especially if he is also right in suggesting thatcasth-which immediately precedes it is also a body of water, perhaps a river or stream.\n\nThe nameSurioccurs also in the third line of theTabula Capuana. The wordteisgenerally means \"these\" as, for example in line 10.16 of the Liber Linteus, other forms oftei- occurring in 2.11, 2.13 and at 9.17. The termev-may be connected to the termesv-in the Liber Linteus (4.15, 4.20) (and, asiśv-, at the beginning of the second and third sections of theTabula Capuana), which van der Meer tentatively translates as \"the ides.\"\n\nThe sequencemi menicac marca lurcacapparently includes abbreviations of the termsmarisandmenitafrom side A.The termMarison side A refers to a set of deities represented on mirrors as babies, but little else is known of their function.Note thatmarappears to be used as an abbreviation for or alternate form ofmarison theLiver of Piacenza(numbers 30 and 39), just as it appears (with abbreviate meni-ta) on side B. Pittau, on the other hand, considers it a name forCupid/Eros.\n\nThe wordarat the end of side A can mean simply 'make,' but also 'dedicate/carry out a dedication' as it probably is here, as seen in line 6 of theCippus Perusinus:ipa ama hen naper XII Velθina-θur-aśaraś-- \"that 12hen(arable?) acres of Velthinasshall be dedicated\".The family nameMurinaon side A is well known, since inscriptions indicate that members lived in Tarquinia, Volsinii, the Siena region, Chiusi, and Perugia.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBonfante, G.&L.

  "Leinth": "Leinthis anEtruscan deity. Within Etruscan iconography, it is difficult to distinguish mortals from divine figures without inscriptions. Inscriptions to the god Leinth have only been identified on two bronze mirrors and a single fragment of ceramic, found within an artisan’s zone on an Etruscan site in Italy. It is difficult, with such little evidence, to determine what may seem to be even the most rudimentary qualities of the deity, because the Etruscans did not consistently assign specific genders or attributes to their gods.Leinth appears both as a male and a female on two different bronze mirrors, and aside from the inscription, there seem to be no distinguishing traits to connect the figures.\n\nMirror #1, Perugia\n\n\n## Mirror #1, Perugia\n\n\nOn the bronze mirror from Perugia, Leinth is presented as a heavily clothed woman. A youngHercle, distinguished by his club and lion-skin cape, stands over a defeatedCerberus, the three-headed beast attributed to the underworld. Mean, the Etruscan goddess of victory, crowns Hercle with a wreath, perhaps in respect to his success of his labor. Leinth stands to the right of this victorious scene, both looking and pointing away from the center towards some unknown. The name Leinth has been associated with the Etruscan word to die, “lein”.Following this connection, it makes sense for a deity, likely linked to death, to be present in a scene that appears to take place in the underworld, as suggested by the presence of Cerberus. While we may establish the connection between the setting of this mirror’s scene with the etymology of Leinth’s name, we cannot conjecture what Leinth’s role within the scene may be. She appears to be distracted by something just out of view, and whatever she is witnessing must be important enough for her to gesture towards the mystery. Beyond this interpretation, we must be reminded that this mirror could very well represent an Etruscan myth that has been lost to us.\n\nMirror #2, Chiusi\n\n\n## Mirror #2, Chiusi\n\n\nAnother bronze mirror depicts the divine Leinth, though this time he is indicated as a male. The mirror presents a scene involving multiple divinities. Leinth appears as a nude male, leaning on a spear and holding a baby.Turan, the goddess of love, stands to his left, draped in cloth and jewelry as she observes the goddessMenrvahandling another baby. Menrva wears a crested helmet and jewelry, although unlike Turan, Menrva has an exposed breast. This is indicative that the goddess may intend to nurse the infant. It is unclear whether she is actively dipping the child into an amphora or simply pulling the child out from it, however both postulations seem to suggest a ritualistic event that concerns the protection of young children. Leinth and the unnamed opposite nude male both lean on spears and look onto the scene, in poses that suggest they serve a protective function. Leinth engages in the activity, holding a child on his left leg while the infant clings to his outstretched right arm. Once again, the narrative that may have accompanied this scene is lost to modern-day scholars, but there is room for inference. Notably, the goddess Recial appears in the lower exergue of the mirror. Recial, or Rescial, is identified as the goddess of rejuvenation. Her name may be drawn from the Etruscan word “sval”, to live.The presence of such a dichotomy, a god linked with death and a goddess connected to new life, presents an interesting dynamic within the context of the scene. One suggested explanation volunteers that the infants may be representative of newborn spirits that are being inducted into the protection of Menrva, who was the guardian of Etruscan children.\n\nInscription\n\n\n## Inscription\n\n\nThe final evidence of the enigmatic Leinth figure comes in the form of yet another inscription, though this time on a fragment of ceramic. Within the sanctuary of the artisans at the Etruscan site of Cetamura del Chianti, a single sherd of black-gloss was discovered bearing the inscription “milein”. This was read as “mi Lein”, which would translate to “I [am of] Lein...”.This is the first dedicatory inscription to have been reported on and attributed to the divine Leinth, but its location within the artisans’ zone may help classify the deity as a figure of success and fortune. The artisans would present offerings to the gods in hopes of success in their work. For example, a potter may devote an offering to the gods prior to firing a large batch of ceramics, with the intentions that a specific god or goddess would see the dedication and be pleased enough to grant the potter success in his handicraft.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n\nDe Grummond, Nancy Thomson.A Guide to Etruscan Mirrors.

  "Liber Linteus": "This article includes a list ofgeneral references, butit lacks sufficient correspondinginline citations.Please help toimprovethis article byintroducingmore precise citations.(February 2013)(Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nTheLiber Linteus Zagrabiensis(Latinfor \"Linen Book of Zagreb\",  also known rarely asLiber Agramensis, \"Book ofAgram\") is the longestEtruscantext and the only extantlinenbook (libri lintei), dated to the 3rd century BC, making it arguably the oldest extant European book. (The second longest Etruscan text,Tabula Capuana, also seems to be a ritual calendar.) Much of it is untranslated because of the lack of knowledge about the Etruscan language, though the words and phrases which can be understood indicate that the text is most likely a ritualcalendar. Miles Beckwith (2008) states with regard to this text that \"in the last thirty or forty years, our understanding of Etruscan has increased substantially,\" andL. B. van der Meerhas published a word-by-word analysis of the entire text.\n\nThe fabric of the book was preserved when it was used formummywrappings inPtolemaic Egypt. The mummy was bought in Alexandria in 1848 and since 1867 both the mummy and the manuscript have been kept inZagreb,Croatia, now in a refrigerated room at theArchaeological Museum.\n\nHistory of discovery\n\n\n## History of discovery\n\n\nIn 1848, Mihajlo Barić (1791–1859), a low rankingCroatianofficial in theHungarianRoyal Chancellery, resigned his post and embarked upon a tour of several countries, includingEgypt. While inAlexandria, he purchased asarcophaguscontaining a female mummy, as a souvenir of his travels. Barić displayed the mummy at his home inVienna, standing it upright in the corner of his sitting room. At some point he removed the linen wrappings and put them on display in a separate glass case, though it seems he had never noticed the inscriptions or their importance.\n\nThe mummy remained on display at his home until his death in 1859, when it passed into possession of his brother Ilija, a priest inSlavonia. As he took no interest in the mummy, he donated it in 1867 to the State Institute of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia inZagreb(the present-dayArchaeological Museum in Zagreb). Their catalogue described it as follows:\n\nMummy of a young woman (with wrappings removed) standing in a glass case and held upright by an iron rod. Another glass case contains the mummy's bandages which are completely covered with writing in an unknown and hitherto undeciphered language, representing an outstanding treasure of the National Museum.\n\nThe mummy and its wrappings were examined the same year by the GermanEgyptologistHeinrich Brugsch, who noticed the text, but believed them to beEgyptian hieroglyphs. He did not undertake any further research on the text, until 1877, when a chance conversation withRichard Burtonaboutrunesmade him realise that the writing was not Egyptian. They realised the text was potentially important, but wrongly concluded that it was a transliteration of the EgyptianBook of the Deadin theArabic script.\n\nIn 1891, the wrappings were transported to Vienna, where they were thoroughly examined byJakob Krall, an expert on theCoptic language, who expected the writing to be either Coptic,LibyanorCarian. In 1892, Krall was the first to identify the language as Etruscan and reassemble the strips. It was his work that established that the linen wrappings constituted a manuscript written in Etruscan.\n\nAt first, the provenance and identity of the mummy were unknown, due to the irregular nature of its excavation and sale. This resulted in speculation that the mummy may have had some association with either theLiber Linteusor theEtruscans. A papyrus found within her sarcophagus was identified as an EgyptianBook of the Dead, which included the details of an Egyptian woman named Nesi-hensu, the wife of Paher-hensu, a tailor fromThebes. This discovery has been used as evidence to suggest that the mummy is the Nesi-hensu mentioned on the papyrus.However, later analysis of the papyrus has suggested that it postdates the mummy by nearly a century, which could suggest that the mummy is not Nesi-hensu.\n\nShe was 30–40 years old at the time of her death, and wore a necklace, with traces of flowers and gold in her hair. Among the fragments of the accompanying wreath, there was a cat skull.\n\nDate and origin\n\n\n### Date and origin\n\n\nOn paleographic grounds, the manuscript is dated to approximately 250 BC (though carbon dating put manufacture of the linen textile itself at 390 BC +/- 45 years).Certain local gods mentioned within the text allow theLiber Linteus's place of production to be narrowed to a small area in the southeast ofTuscanynearLake Trasimeno, where four major Etruscan cities were located: modern dayArezzo,Perugia,ChiusiandCortona.\n\nThe book is laid out in twelve columns from right to left, each one representing a \"page\". Much of the first three columns is missing, and it is not known where the book begins. Closer to the end of the book the text is almost complete (there is a strip missing that runs the entire length of the book). By the end of the last page the cloth is blank and theselvageis intact, showing the definite end of the book.\n\nThere are 230 lines of text, with 1330 legible words, but only about 500 distinct words or roots.Only about 60% of the text is thought to have been preserved. Black ink has been used for the main text, and red ink for lines anddiacritics.\n\nIn use, it would have been folded so that one page lay on top of another like acodex, rather than being wound along like ascroll. Julius Caesar is said to have folded scrolls in similaraccordionfashion while on campaigns.\n\nThough the Etruscan language is not fully understood, many words and phrases can be deciphered, enough to give us an indication of the subject matter. Both dates and the names of gods are found throughout the text, giving the impression that the book is a religious calendar. Such calendars are known from the Roman world, giving not only the dates of ceremonies and processions, but also the rituals and liturgies involved. The lostEtrusca disciplinaare referred to by several Roman antiquarians.\n\nThe theory that this is a religious text is strengthened by recurring words and phrases that are surmised to have liturgical or dedicatory meanings. Some notable formulae on the Liber Linteus include a hymn-like repetition ofceia hiain column 7, and variations on the phraseśacnicstreś cilθś śpureśtreśc enaś, which is translated by van der Meer as  \"by the sacred fraternity/priesthood ofcilθ,  and by thecivitasofenaś\".\n\nThough many of the specific details of the rituals are unclear, they seem to have been performed outside cities, sometimes near specific rivers, sometimes on (or at least for) hilltops/citadels, sometimes apparently in cemeteries. Based on the two unambiguous dates that survive — June 18 in 6.14 and September 24 in 8.2 — it is supposed that roughly columns 1-5 deal with rituals occurring in the months before June (probably starting in March, and perhaps there was introductory or other material here as well), column 6 with June rituals, column 7 may refer to rituals in July and possibly August, column 8 September rituals, and 9-12 concerning rites to be performed from October through February. Other numbers are mentioned which are probably also dates, but as the months are not indicated, we cannot be sure where exactly they fall in the year.\n\nThroughout this calendar there is also a fairly clear progression of which kinds of deities are to be propitiated in which months and seasons. Only two individual gods are set off by being preceded by the termfarθan fleres, probably \"the Genius (or Father?) of the spirit of/in...\" These areCrap-andNeθuns, the first probably equivalent toTin, the EtruscanJupiter, and the second roughly equivalent to LatinNeptune. It is notable thatCrap-/Jupiter is mentioned in the first half of the text (in columns 3, 4, and 6), that is, up to June (specifically before thesummer solsticeon June 21), but he is not ever mentioned later in the calendar (as far as we can see in the text that is legible). On the other hand,Neθuns/Neptune does not occur (again, as far as we can see) in these earlier passages/months/seasons, but only after theautumnal equinoxon September 21 (specifically just after September 24, mentioned in 8.3, then also 8.11, 9.18 and 9.22).\n\nSimilarly, on the one hand, other deities of light, such asθesan\"Dawn\" andLusaare only mentioned in the earlier part of the calendar:θesanat 5.19-20θesan tini θesan eiseraś śeuśprobably \"Dawn of (bright) Jupiter (and) Dawn of the Dark Deities,\" (probably referring toVenusas morning and evening star) andLusaat 6.9; while, on the other hand, various terms thought or known to refer to specifically underworld deities exclusively appear later in the calendar:Satrs\"Saturn/Cronos\" (11.f4),Caθ-(in columns 10 and 12),Ceu-(at 7.8),Velθa(7, 10, and 11), andVeive-/Vetis= LatinVeiovis/Vedius,(described by van der Meer as an \"underworld Jupiter\") in 10 and 11.\n\nBut some of the apparent underworld deities, such asZer, show up in both halves (4, 5, 9), whileLur, also thought to bechthonic, only appears in columns 5 and 6. van der Meer claims that many of the locations in the year of these deities' rituals correspond to the same deities' locations on theLiver of Piacenzaand in other Etruscan sources that hint at how they divided the heavens or the divine realm.On the other hand, Belfiore considersCrapto be an underworld deity.\n\nThere are a variety of types of ritual (the general term for which seems to beeis-na/ ais-naliterally \"for the gods, divine (act)\") described in the text. The most frequently mentioned includevacl, probably \"libation\", usually ofvinum\"wine\" (sometimes specifically \"new wine\") but also of oilfaśand other liquids whose identities are unclear;nunθen\"invoke\" or possibly \"offer (with an invokation)\";θez-probably \"sacrifice\" but possibly \"to present\" sacrifice(s) or offering(s) (fler(χva)) often ofzusle(va)\"piglet(s)\" (or perhaps some other animal). Offerings and sacrifices were placed: on the right and/or lefthamΦeś leiveś(and variations thereof); on fireraχθ; on a stone (altar?)luθt(i); on the groundcel-i; or with/on a decorated (?) littercletram śrenχveamong others. They were often performed three timesci-s-um/ci-zand often happened or were concluded during the morningcla θesan(a term that seems to mark the end of rituals in this text, since blank lines follow it, followed by a new (partial or complete) date). Column 7 (July and/or August?) may be devoted to describing a series of funereal rites connected to theAdoniafestival ritually mourning the death ofAphrodite's loverAdonis.\n\nA variety of types of priest,cepen, (but notably not civil authorities) are mentioned, but the exact distinctions between them are not completely clear:tutin\"of the village\"(?);ceren,θaurχboth \"of the tomb\";cilθ-l/cva\"of the citadel(s)/hiltop(s)\". Less clear are the kinds of priest indicated by the following (if they refer to priests at all):zec, zac, sve, θe, cluctra, flanaχ, χuru(\"arch-\"?),snuiuΦ(\"permanent\"?),cnticn-('\"ad hoc\"?),truθur(\"omen interpreter from lightening\"?),peθereni(\"of the god Peθan\"?),saucsaθ([priest] or [holy area]\"of the god Saucne\") at 3.15 (3.15-3.17):vacl . an . ścanince . saucsaθ . persin / cletram . śrenχve . iχ . ścanince . ciz . vacl / araroughly \"The libation which was poured toSauc- Pers-(should be performed) with the decorated litter just as it had been poured (before); perform the libation three times.\"\n\nThis seems to present a notable connection between the Liber Linteus and the second longest Etruscan text which happens to also be a ritual calendar, theTabula Capuana(line 2), since the rootsauc-seems to occur in both with the rootvacl\"libation\" and also in a part of each text that probably corresponds to March (though that month is not directly named in any obvious way in either text).\n\nShort sample of the text and partial translation\n\n\n### Short sample of the text and partial translation\n\n\nColumn 3, strip C (There are no punctuation marks in the original beyond interpuncts between most words.

  "Maris (mythology)": "Maris(orMariś) was anEtruscangod often depicted as an infant or child and given manyepithets, includingMariś Halna,Mariś Husrnana(\"Maris the Child\"), andMariś Isminthians. He was the son ofHercle, the Etruscan equivalent ofHeracles. On twobronze mirrors, Maris appears in scenes depicting an immersion rite presumably to ensure his immortality.Massimo Pallottinonoted that Maris might have been connected to stories about thecentaurMares, the legendary ancestor of theAusones, who underwent a triple death and resurrection.\n\nSome scholars think he influenced Roman conceptions of the godMars,but this is not universally held; more likely he was the god of fertility and love, similar to the Greek Eros.\n\nIn theLead Plaque of Magliano, he is calledMaris Menita\"Maris the Maker\", the full dedicatory line translated:\n\nFor Maris Menita (=\"the Maker\"), for the ancestors, also this previously mentioned annually appointed village-priest must make a dedication in theciala,and in addition in the place of offering, and in theichuhouse\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n",
  "Menrva": "Menrva(also spelledMenervaorMenfra) was anEtruscan goddessof war, art, wisdom, and medicine. She contributed much of her character to theRomanMinerva. She was the child ofUniandTinia.\n\nAlthough Menrva was seen by Hellenized Etruscans as their counterpart toGreekAthena,Menrva has some unique traits that make it clear that she was not an import from Greece. Etruscan artists under the influence of Greek culture, however, liked to portray Menrva withGorgoneion, helmet, spear, and shield, and, on one mirrorback, as bursting from the head of her father, Tinia.Also, she commonly is seen as the protector ofHercle(Heracles) andPherse(Perseus).On a bronze mirror found atPraeneste, she attends Perseus, who consults twoGraeae,and, on another, holds high the head ofMedusa, while she and seated Perseus andHermesall gaze safely at its reflection in a pool at their feet.These images are more likely to reflect literary sources than anycult practice.On a bronze mirror fromBolsena,c.300 BCE, she is portrayed attending a scene of Prometheus Unbound withEsplace (Asclepius), who bandages Prometheus' chest.\n\nOften, Menrva is depicted in a more essentially Etruscan style, as a lightning thrower.Martianusmentions her as one of nine Etruscan lightning deities. Etruscan style works often depict Menrva with a thunderbolt; the thunderbolt imagery seems to be unique to Etruscan Menrva images.\n\nMenrva seems to have been associated with weather phenomena. The Greeks never attributed an association with weather to Athena,making this another important difference between the two religious cults that demonstrates their separate characteristics.\n\nMenrva's name is indigenous to Italy and might even be of Etruscan origin, stemming from an Italic moon goddess,*Meneswā'She who measures'.It is thought that the Etruscans adopted the inherited Old Latin name,*Menerwā, thereby calling her Menrva. However, this has been disputed.Carl Becker suggests that her name appears to contain thePIEroot*men-, which he notes was linked in Greek primarily to memory words (cf. Greek \"mnestis\"/μνῆστις 'memory, remembrance, recollection'), but which more generally referred to 'mind' in most Indo-European languages.\n\nMenrva was part of atriple deitywith Uni and Tinia, later reflected in the RomanCapitoline TriadofJuno,Jupiter, andMinerva.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n## External links\n\n\nMedia related toMenrvaat Wikimedia Commons",
  "Priestesses": "Apriestis areligious leaderauthorized to perform the sacredritualsof a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or moredeities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the \"priesthood\", a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. A priest may have the duty to hear confessions periodically, give marriage counseling, provide prenuptial counseling, give spiritual direction, teachcatechism, or visit those confined indoors, such as the sick in hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nDescription\n\n\n## Description\n\n\nAccording to thetrifunctional hypothesisof prehistoricProto-Indo-European society, priests have existed since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies, most likely as a result ofagriculturalsurplus and consequentsocial stratification.The necessity to read sacred texts and keep temple or church records helped foster literacy in many early societies. Priests exist in many religions today, such as all or some branches ofJudaism,Christianity,Buddhism,Shinto, andHinduism. They are generally regarded as having privileged contact with thedeityor deities of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. There is no common definition of the duties of priesthood between faiths; but generally it includes mediating the relationship between one's congregation,worshippers, and other members of the religious body, and its deity or deities, and administering religiousritualsand rites. These often include blessing worshipers with prayers of joy at marriages, after a birth, and atconsecrations, teaching the wisdom anddogmaof the faith at any regular worship service, and mediating and easing the experience of grief and death at funerals – maintaining a spiritual connection to theafterlifein faiths where such a concept exists. Administering religious building grounds and office affairs and papers, including any religious library or collection ofsacred texts, is also commonly a responsibility – for example, the modern term forclerical dutiesin a secular office refers originally to the duties of acleric. The question of which religions have a \"priest\" depends on how the titles of leaders are used or translated into English. In some cases, leaders are more like those that other believers will often turn to for advice on spiritual matters, and less of a \"person authorized to perform the sacred rituals.\" For example,clergyinRoman CatholicismandEastern Orthodoxyarepriests, as with certain synods ofLutheranismandAnglicanism, though other branches ofProtestant Christianity, such as Methodists and Baptists, useministerandpastor.The termspriestandpriestessare sufficiently generic that they may be used in ananthropologicalsense to describe the religious mediators of an unknown or otherwise unspecified religion.\n\nIn many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling out any other career. Many Christian priests and pastors choose or are mandated to dedicate themselves to their churches and receive their living directly from their churches. In other cases, it is a part-time role. For example, in the earlyhistory of Icelandthe chieftains were titledgoði, a word meaning \"priest\". As seen in thesagaofHrafnkell Freysgoði, however, being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to theNorsegods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.\n\nIn some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human choice. In Judaism, the priesthood is inherited in familial lines. In atheocracy, a society isgovernedby its priesthood.\n\nThe word \"priest\", is ultimately derived from Latin viaGreekpresbyter,the term for \"elder\", especially elders of Jewish or Christian communities inlate antiquity. The Latinpresbyterultimately represents Greekπρεσβύτεροςpresbúteros, the regular Latin word for \"priest\" beingsacerdos, corresponding toἱερεύςhiereús.\n\nIt is possible that the Latin word was loaned intoOld English, and only from Old English reached other Germanic languages via theAnglo-Saxon missionto the continent, givingOld Icelandicprestr,Old Swedishpräster,Old High Germanpriast. Old High German also has the disyllabicpriester, priestar, apparently derived from Latin independently viaOld Frenchpresbtre.\n\nAn alternative theory makespriestcognate with Old High Germanpriast,prest, fromVulgar Latin*prevost\"one put over others\", from Latinpraepositus\"person placed in charge\".\n\nThat English should have only the single termpriestto translatepresbyterandsacerdoscame to be seen as a problem inEnglish Bible translations. Thepresbyteris the minister who both presides and instructs a Christian congregation, while thesacerdos, offerer ofsacrifices, or in a Christian context theeucharist, performs \"mediatorial offices between God and man\".\n\nThe feminine English noun,priestess, was coined in the 17th century, to refer to female priests of the pre-Christian religions of classical antiquity. In the 20th century, the word was used in controversies surrounding thewomen ordained in the Anglican communion, who are referred to as \"priests\", irrespective of gender, and the term priestess is generally considered archaic in Christianity.\n\nWebster's 1829 Dictionary stated \"PRIEST,noun[Latin proestes, a chief, one that presides; proe, before, and sto, to stand, or sisto.]\"https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/priest\n\nHistorical religions\n\n\n## Historical religions\n\n\nIn historicalpolytheism, a priest administers thesacrificeto a deity, often in highly elaborateritual. In theAncient Near East, the priesthood also acted on behalf of the deities in managing their property.\n\nPriestesses in antiquity often performedsacred prostitution, and in Ancient Greece, some priestesses such asPythia, priestess atDelphi, acted asoracles.\n\nAncient priests and priestesses\n\n\n### Ancient priests and priestesses\n\n\nSumerianen(Akkadian:entu), includingEnheduanna(c.23rd century BCE), were top-ranking priests who were distinguished with special ceremonial attire and held equal status to high priests. They owned property, transacted business, and initiated thehieros gamoswith priests and kings.Nadītuserved as priestesses in the temples ofInannain the city ofUruk. They were recruited from the highest families in the land and were supposed to remain childless, owned property, and transacted business.The Sumerian wordnin,EREŠin Akkadian, is the sign for \"lady.\"nin.dingir(Akkadianentu), literally \"divine lady\", a priestess.In Sumerian epic texts such as \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\",nu-gigwere priestesses in temples dedicated to Inanna and may be a reference to the goddess herself.PuabiofUrwas an Akkadianqueen regnantor a priestess. In several other Sumerian city-states, the ruling governor or king was also a head priest with the rank ofensi, such as atLagash.Control of the holy city ofNippurand its temple priesthood generally meant hegemony over most of Sumer, as listed on theSumerian King List; at one point, the Nippur priesthood conferred the title of queen of Sumer on Kugbau, a popular taverness from nearbyKish(who was later deified asKubaba).In theHebrew Bible,Hebrew:קְדֵשָׁהqědēšā,derived from the rootQ-D-Šwere sacred prostitutes usually associated with the goddessAsherah.Quadishtuserved in the temples of the Sumerian goddessQetesh.Ishtarituspecialized in the arts of dancing, music, and singing and they served in the temples ofIshtar.In theEpic of Gilgamesh, priestessShamhat, a temple prostitute, tamed wildEnkiduafter \"six days and seven nights.\"Gerarai, fourteenAthenianmatrons ofDionysus, presided over sacrifices and participated in the festivals ofAnthesteria.\n\nAncient Egypt\n\n\n### Ancient Egypt\n\n\nInancient Egyptian religion, the right and obligation to interact with thegodsbelonged to thepharaoh. He delegated this duty to priests, who were effectively bureaucrats authorized to act on his behalf. Priests staffedtemplesthroughout Egypt, giving offerings to thecult imagesin which the gods were believed to take up residence and performing other rituals for their benefit.Little is known about what training may have been required of priests, and the selection of personnel for positions was affected by a tangled set of traditions, although the pharaoh had the final say. In theNew Kingdom of Egypt, when temples owned great estates, the high priests of the most important cult—that ofAmunatKarnak—were important political figures.\n\nHigh-ranking priestly roles were usually held by men. Women were generally relegated to lower positions in the temple hierarchy, although some held specialized and influential positions, especially that of theGod's Wife of Amun, whose religious importance overshadowed theHigh Priests of Amunin theLate Period.\n\nAncient Rome\n\n\n### Ancient Rome\n\n\nInancient Romeand throughout Italy, the ancient sanctuaries ofCeresandProserpinawere invariably led by femalesacerdotes, drawn from women of local and Roman elites. It was the only public priesthood attainable by Roman matrons and was held in great honor.\n\nA Roman matron was any mature woman of the upper class, married or unmarried. Females could serve public cult asVestal Virginsbut few were chosen, and then only from young maidens of the upper class.\n\nAncient Greece\n\n\n### Ancient Greece\n\n\nThePythiawas the title of a priestess at the very ancient temple ofDelphithat was dedicated to theEarth Mother. She was widely credited for herprophecies. The priestess retained her role when the temple was rededicated toApollo, giving her a prominence unusual for a woman in the male-dominated culture ofclassical Greece.ThePhrygian Sibylwas the priestess presiding over anApollonianoracleatPhrygia, a historical kingdom in theAnatolianhighlands.\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\n\n## Abrahamic religions\n\n\nHistorical\n\n\n#### Historical\n\n\nAfterthe departure of the Israelites from Egypt, priests inancient Israelwere required by theLaw of Mosesto be directpatrileneal descendantsofAaron, the elder brother ofMoses. In Exodus 30:22–25Godinstructs Moses to make aholy anointing-oilto consecrate the priests \"for all of eternity\". During the times of the two JewishTemples in Jerusalem, the Aaronic priests performed the daily and specialJewish-holidayofferings and sacrifices within the temples; these offerings are known as thekorbanot.\n\nIn Hebrew, the word for \"priest\" iskohen(singular כהןkohen, plural כּהנִיםkohanim), hence the family namesCohen,Cahn,Kahn,Kohn,Kogan, etc. Jewish families with these names belong to thetribe of Levi(Levites– descended fromLevi, the great-grandfather of Aaron) and in twenty-four instances are called by scripture as such.[need quotation to verify]In Hebrew, the word for \"priesthood\" iskehunnah.\n\nThe Hebrew wordkohencomes from therootKWN/KON כ-ו-ן 'to stand, to be ready, established'in the sense of \"someone who stands ready before God\",and has cognates in otherSemitic languages, e.g.PhoenicianKHN 𐤊𐤄𐤍 \"priest\"orArabickahinكاهن \"priest\".\n\nModern Judaism\n\n\n#### Modern Judaism\n\n\nSince thedestruction of the Second Temple, and (therefore) the cessation of the daily and seasonal temple ceremonies and sacrifices,kohanimhave become much less prominent. In traditional Judaism (Orthodox Judaismand to some extent,Conservative Judaism) a few priestly andLeviticalfunctions, such as thepidyon haben(redemption of a first-born son) ceremony and thePriestly Blessing, have been retained. Especially in Orthodox Judaism, kohanim remain subject to a number of restrictions concerning matters related to marriage andritual purity.\n\nOrthodox Judaismregard the kohanim as being held in reserve for a futurerestored Temple. Kohanim do not perform roles of propitiation, sacrifice, or sacrament in any branch ofRabbinical Judaismor inKaraite Judaism. The principal religious function of any kohanim is to perform thePriestly Blessing, although an individual kohen may also become arabbior other professional religious leader.\n\nBeta Israel\n\n\n##### Beta Israel\n\n\nThe traditionalBeta Israelcommunity in Israel had little direct contact with other Jewish groups after the destruction of the temple and developed separately for almost two thousand years. While some Beta Israel now follow Rabbinical Jewish practices, the Ethiopian Jewish religious tradition (Haymanot) uses the wordKahento refer to a type non-hereditary cleric.\n\nSamaritanism\n\n\n### Samaritanism\n\n\nAaronic Kohanim also officiated at theSamaritantemple onMount Gerizim. The Samaritan kohanim have retained their role as religious leaders.\n\nChristianity\n\n\n### Christianity\n\n\nWith the spread of Christianity and the formation ofparishes, the Greek wordἱερεύςhiereúsand Latin wordsacerdos, which Christians had since the 3rd century applied tobishopsand only in a secondary sense topresbyters, began in the 6th century to be used of presbyters,and is today commonly used of presbyters, distinguishing them from bishops.\n\nToday, the term \"priest\" is used in theCatholic Church,Eastern Orthodoxy,Oriental Orthodoxy, theChurch of the East, and many branches ofLutheranismandAnglicanism, to refer to those who have beenordainedto a ministerial position through receiving thesacramentofHoly Orders, although \"presbyter\" is also used.Since theProtestant Reformation, non-sacramental denominations are more likely to use the term \"elder\" to refer to their pastors. The Christian term \"priest\" does not have an entry in theAnchor Bible Dictionary, but the dictionary does deal with the above-mentioned terms under the entry for \"Sheep, Shepherd.\".\n\nIn Western Christianity, priests are usually styled \"The Reverend\".\n\nEastern Orthodoxy\n\n\n#### Eastern Orthodoxy\n\n\nIn Orthodoxy, the normal minimum age is thirty (Can. 11 of Neocaesarea) but a bishop may dispense with this if needed. In neither tradition may priests marry after ordination. In the Catholic Church, priests in the Latin Church must becelibateexcept under special rules for married clergy converting from certain other Christian confessions.Married men may become priests inEastern Orthodoxy, but cannot marry after ordination, even if they become widowed. In the view of the Eastern Orthodox Churches:\n\nBy allowing married men to enter the priesthood, the Orthodox Church affirms the blessedness of marriage without lessening the affirmation of the blessedness of celibacy. St Clement of Alexandria writes: “Celibacy and marriage each have their own functions and specific services to the Lord”, and so “we pay homage to those whom the Lord has favoured with the gift of celibacy and admire monogamy and its dignity” (The Stromata, Book 3). Marriage according to the will of Christ, and celibacy as a devotion to Christ, are two different spiritual paths, equally valid for a true living of the spiritual life. This is so for ordained clergy as it is for everyone else.\n\nCandidates for bishop are chosen only from among the celibate. Orthodox priests will either wear aclerical collarsimilar to the above-mentioned, or simply a very loose black robe that does not have a collar. The garb of an Eastern Orthodox priest is generally the same as that of anEastern CatholicorEastern Lutheranpriest.\n\nOriental Orthodoxy\n\n\n#### Oriental Orthodoxy\n\n\nIn theOriental Orthodox Churches, there are different orders of ministry, each with different vestments.The order of the priest is known as theKashisho.\n\nIn addition to the ministerial priesthood, Oriental Orthodoxy does affirm thepriesthood of believers, which is called theUlmoyo.\n\nCatholicism\n\n\n#### Catholicism\n\n\nIn these traditions, only men who meet certain requirements may become priests. In Catholicism, thecanonicalminimum age is twenty-five. Bishops may dispense with this rule and ordain men up to one year younger. Dispensations of more than a year are reserved to theHoly See(Can. 1031 §§ 1, 4.) A Catholic priest must beincardinatedby his bishop or his major religioussuperiorin order to engage in public ministry.Secular priestsare incardinated into adiocese, whereas religious priests live theconsecrated lifeand can work anywhere in the world that their specific community operates.\n\nMarried men may become priests in theEastern Catholic Churches, but cannot marry after ordination, even if they become widowed.\n\nLutheranism\n\n\n#### Lutheranism\n\n\nConservative Lutheran reforms are reflected in the theological and practical view of the ministry of the church. Much of European Lutheranism follows the traditional Catholic governance of deacon, priest, and bishop. The Lutheran archbishops of Finland, Sweden, etc. and Baltic countries are the historic national primates and some ancient cathedrals and parishes in the Lutheran church were constructed many centuries before the Reformation. Indeed, ecumenical work within the Moravian Church, Anglican Communion and among Scandinavian Lutherans mutually recognize thehistoric apostolic legitimacyandfull communion. Likewise in America, Lutherans have embraced the apostolic succession of bishops in the full communion with Moravians and Episcopalians. Most Lutheran ordinations are performed by a bishop.\n\nTheChurch of Swedenhas a threefold ministry of bishop, priest, and deacon and those ordained to the presbyterate are referred to as priests.In theEvangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, ordained presbyters are referred to by various publications, including Finnish ones, as pastors,or priests.In the United States, denominations like theLutheran Church–Missouri Synoduse the terms \"reverend\" and \"pastor\" interchangeably for ordained members of the clergy;theLutheran Church - International, a Confessional Lutheran denomination ofEvangelical Catholicchurchmanship, uses the term \"priest\" for those ordained to the presbyterate, who are addressed as \"Father\".\n\nApart from the ministerial priesthood, the general priesthood or thepriesthood of all believers, is aChristiandoctrine derived from several passages of theNew Testament. It is a foundational concept ofProtestantism.It is this doctrine thatMartin Lutheradduces in his 1520To the Christian Nobility of the German Nationin order to dismiss the medieval Christian belief that Christians were to be divided into two classes: \"spiritual\" and \"temporal\" or non-spiritual.\n\nAnglican or Episcopalian\n\n\n#### Anglican or Episcopalian\n\n\nThe role of a priest in theAnglican Communionand theFree Church of Englandis largely the same as within theRoman Catholic ChurchandEastern Christianity, except thatcanon lawin almost everyAnglicanprovince restricts the administration ofconfirmationto thebishop, just as withordination. Although Anglican priests who are members ofreligious ordersmust remaincelibate(although there are exceptions, such as priests in theAnglican Order of Cistercians), thesecular clergy—bishops, priests, and deacons who are not members of religious orders—are permitted to marry before or after ordination (although in most provinces they are not permitted tomarry a person of the same sex). The Anglican churches, unlike the Roman Catholic orEastern Christiantraditions, have allowed the ordination of women as priests (referred to as \"priests\" not \"priestesses\") in some provinces since 1971.This practice remains controversial, however; a minority of provinces (10 out of the 38 worldwide) retain an all-male priesthood.MostContinuing Anglicanchurches do not ordain women to the priesthood.\n\nAs Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion, itspresbyterateincludes priests who consider themselves no different in any respect from those of the Roman Catholic Church, and a minority who prefer to use the titlepresbyterin order to distance themselves from the more sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the wordpriest.\n\nWhilepriestis the official title of a member of the presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide (retained by the Elizabethan Settlement), the ordination rite of certain provinces (including theChurch of England) recognizes the breadth of opinion by adopting the titleThe Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters).Even though both words mean 'elders' historically the termpriesthas been more associated with the \"High Church\" orAnglo-Catholicwing, whereas the term \"minister\" has been more commonly used in \"Low Church\" or Evangelical circles.\n\nLatter Day Saints\n\n\n#### Latter Day Saints\n\n\nIn theLatter Day Saint movement, the priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man, including the authority to performordinancesand to act as a leader in the church. A body of priesthood holders is referred to as aquorum. Priesthood denotes elements of both power and authority. The priesthood includes the powerJesusgave hisapostlesto perform miracles such as the casting out of devils and the healing of sick (Luke9:1). Latter Day Saints believe that theBiblicalmiracles performed byprophetsand apostles were performed by the power of the priesthood, including the miracles of Jesus, who holds all of the keys of the priesthood. The priesthood is formally known as the \"Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God\", but to avoid the too frequent use of the name of deity, the priesthood is referred to as the Melchizedek priesthood (Melchizedekbeing the high priest to whomAbrahampaid tithes). As an authority, the priesthood is the authority by which a bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts of service in the name of God. Latter Day Saints believe that acts (and in particular,ordinances) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven, on earth, and in the afterlife.\n\nThere is some variation among the Latter Day Saint denominations regarding who can be ordained to the priesthood. Inthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints(LDS Church), all worthy males above the age of 12 can be ordained to the priesthood. However, prior to apolicy change in 1978, the LDS Church did not ordain men or boys who were of black African descent. The LDS Church does not ordain women to any of its priesthood offices. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ), the second largest denomination of the movement, began ordaining women to all of its priesthood offices in 1984. This decision was one of the reasons that led to a schism in the church, which prompted the formation of the independentRestoration Branchesmovement from which other denominations have sprung, including theRemnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nIslam has nosacerdotalpriesthood. There are, however, a variety of academic and administrative offices which have evolved to assist Muslims with this task, such as theimāmsand themullāhs.\n\nAMandaean priestrefers to an ordained religious leader inMandaeism. InMandaean scriptures, priests are referred to asNaṣuraiia(Naṣoraeans).All priests must undergo lengthy ordination ceremonies, beginning withtarmidainitiation.Mandaean religious leaders and copyists of religious texts hold the titleRabbior in Arabic 'Sheikh'.\n\nAll Mandaean communities traditionally require the presence of a priest, since priests are required to officiate over all important religious rituals, includingmasbuta,masiqta, birth and wedding ceremonies. Priests also serve as teachers, scribes, and community leaders.\n\nThere are three types of priests inMandaeism:\n\nrišama\"leader of the people\"ganzibria\"treasurers\" (from Old Persianganza-bara\"id.,\" Neo-Mandaicganzeḇrānā)tarmidia\"disciples\" (Neo-Mandaictarmidānā)\n\nPriests have lineages based on the succession ofganzibriapriests who had initiated them. Priestly lineages, which are distinct from birth lineages, are typically recorded in thecolophonsof manyMandaean texts. The position is not hereditary, and any Mandaean male who is highly knowledgeable about religious matters is eligible to become a priest.\n\nEastern religions\n\n\n## Eastern religions\n\n\nAHindupriest traditionally comes from theBrahmincommunity.Priests are ordained and trained as well. There are two types of Hindu priests,pujaris(swamis,yogis, andgurus) andpurohitas(pandits). Apujariperforms rituals in a temple. These rituals include bathing themurtis (the statues of the gods/goddesses), performingpuja, a ritualistic offering of various items to the gods, the waving of agheeor oil lamp also called an offering in light, known in Hinduism asaarti, before themurtis.Pujarisare often married.\n\nApurohita, on the other hand, performs rituals andsaṃskāras(sacraments),yajnas(sacrifices) outside of the temple. There are specialpurohitaswho perform only funeral rites.\n\nIn many cases, apurohitaalso functions as apujari.\n\nWhile only men have traditionally been  ordained as priests in the past, recent developments such as feminism in India have led to the opening of training schools for women to become priests.\n\nZoroastrianism\n\n\n### Zoroastrianism\n\n\nA Zoroastrian priest are called a Mobad and they officiate theYasna, pouring libations into the sacred fire to the accompaniment of ritual chants. The Mobad also prepare drinks for thehaomaritual.\n\nIn IndianZoroastrianism, the priesthood is reserved for men and is a mostly hereditary position,but women have been ordained in Iran and North America as a mobedyar, meaning an assistant mobed.\n\nTheTaoist priests(道士 \"master of theDao\" p. 488) act as interpreters of the principles of Yin-Yang5 elements(fire, water, soil, wood, and metal p. 53) school of ancient Chinese philosophy, as they relate to marriage, death, festival cycles, and so on. The Taoist priest seeks to share the benefits of meditation with his or her community through public ritual and liturgy (p. 326). In the ancient priesthood before the Tang, the priest was calledJijiu(\"libationer\" p. 550), with both male and female practitioners selected by merit. The system gradually changed into a male only hereditary Taoist priesthood until more recent times (p. 550,551).\n\nIndigenous and ethnic religions\n\n\n## Indigenous and ethnic religions\n\n\nThis articleneeds additional citations forverification.Please helpimprove this articlebyadding citations to reliable sources.

A kannushi is the person responsible for the maintenance of a Shinto shrine, orjinja, purificatory rites, and for leading worship and veneration of a certainkami. Additionally,kannushiare aided by another priest class,miko(巫女; \"shrine maidens\"), for many rites. The maidens may either be family members in training, apprentices, or local volunteers.\n\nSaiinwere female relatives of the Japanese emperor (termedsaiō) who served as High Priestesses inKamo Shrine.Saiōalso served atIse Shrine.Saiinpriestesses usually were elected from royalty. In principle,Saiinremained unmarried, but there were exceptions. SomeSaiinbecameconsortsof the emperor, calledNyōgoin Japanese. TheSaiinorder of priestesses existed throughout the Heian and Kamakura periods.\n\nTheYoruba peopleof westernNigeriapractice an indigenous religion with achieflyhierarchy of priests and priestesses that dates to AD 800–1000.Ifá priests and priestesses bear the titlesBabalawofor men andIyanifafor women.Priests and priestesses of the variedOrishaare titled Babalorisa for men and Iyalorisa for women.Initiates are also given an Orisa or Ifá name that signifies under which deity they are initiated. For example, a Priestess ofOsunmay be named Osunyemi, and a Priest ofIfámay be named Ifáyemi. This traditional culture continues to this day as initiates from all around the world return to Nigeria for initiation into the priesthood, and varied derivative sects in the New World (such asCubanSanteríaand BrazilianUmbanda) use the same titles to refer to their officers as well.\n\nIn akingdom, tribe or clan inAfricathe traditional leader is also a priest cause of his mission between the spirit of ancestors ( Throne ) and people. Everything the traditional ruler must do,  is according to the ritual, ceremony and worship. They call him sometimes royal Priest.\n\nAfro-Latin American religions\n\n\n### Afro-Latin American religions\n\n\nIn Brazil, the priests in theUmbanda,CandombléandQuimbandareligions are calledpai-de-santo(literally \"Father of saint\" in English), or \"babalorixá\" (a word borrowed fromYorubabàbálórìsà, meaningFather of theOrisha); its female equivalent is themãe-de-santo(\"Mother of saint\"), also referred to as \"ialorixá\" (Yoruba:iyálórìsà).\n\nIn theCubanSantería, a male priest is calledSantero, while female priests are calledIyanifasor \"mothers of wisdom\".\n\nNeo-paganism\n\n\n## Neo-paganism\n\n\nAccording to traditionalWiccanbeliefs, every member of the religion is considered a priestess or priest, as it is believed that no person can stand between another and the divine. However, in response to the growing number of Wiccan temples andchurches, several denominations of the religion have begun to develop a core group of ordained priestesses and priests serving a larger laity. This trend is far from widespread, but is gaining acceptance due to increased interest in the religion.\n\nThe dress of religious workers in ancient times may be demonstrated in frescoes and artifacts from the cultures. The dress is presumed to be related to the customary clothing of the culture, with some symbol of the deity worn on the head or held by the person. Sometimes special colors, materials, or patterns distinguish celebrants, as the white wool veil draped on the head of theVestal Virgins.\n\nOccasionally, the celebrants at religious ceremonies shed all clothes in a symbolic gesture of purity. This was often the case in ancient times. An example of this is shown to the left on a Kylix dating from c. 500 BC where a priestess is featured. Modern religious groups tend to avoid such symbolism and some may be quite uncomfortable with the concept.\n\nThe retention of longskirtsandvestmentsamong many ranks of contemporary priests when they officiate may be interpreted to express the ancient traditions of the cultures from which their religious practices arose.\n\nIn most Christian traditions, priests wearclerical clothing, a distinctive form of street dress. Even within individual traditions it varies considerably in form, depending on the specific occasion. InWestern Christianity, the stiff whiteclerical collarhas become the nearly universal feature of priestly clerical clothing, worn either with acassockor aclergy shirt. The collar may be either a full collar or a vestigial tab displayed through a square cutout in the shirt collar.\n\nEastern Christianpriests mostly retain the traditional dress of two layers of differently cut cassock: therasson(Greek) orpodriasnik(Russian) beneath the outerexorasson(Greek) orriasa(Russian). If a pectoral cross has been awarded it is usually worn with street clothes in the Russian tradition, but not so often in the Greek tradition.\n\nDistinctive clerical clothing is less often worn in modern times than formerly, and in many cases it is rare for a priest to wear it when not acting in a pastoral capacity, especially in countries that view themselves as largely secular in nature. There are frequent exceptions to this however, and many priests rarely if ever go out in public without it, especially in countries where their religion makes up a clear majority of the population.Pope John Paul IIoften instructed Catholic priests and religious to always wear their distinctive (clerical) clothing, unless wearing it would result in persecution or grave verbal attacks.\n\nChristian traditions that retain the title of priest also retain the tradition of special liturgicalvestmentsworn only during services. Vestments vary widely among the different Christian traditions.\n\nIn modernPaganreligions, such asWicca, there is no one specific form of dress designated for the clergy. If there is, it is a particular of the denomination in question, and not a universal practice. However, there is a traditional form of dress, (usually a floor-lengthtunicand a knotted cordcincture, known as thecingulum), which is often worn by worshipers during religious rites. Among those traditions of Wicca that do dictate a specific form of dress for its clergy, they usually wear the traditional tunic in addition to other articles of clothing (such as an open-frontedrobeor acloak) as a distinctive form of religious dress, similar to ahabit.\n\nAssistant priest\n\n\n## Assistant priest\n\n\nIn many religions, there are one or more layers of assistant priests.\n\nIn theAncient Near East,hierodulesserved in temples as assistants to the priestess.\n\nIn ancient Judaism, the Priests (Kohanim) had a whole class of Levites as their assistants in making the sacrifices, in singingpsalmsand in maintaining theTemple. The Priests and the Levites were in turn served by servants calledNethinim. These lowest level of servants were not priests.\n\nAn assistant priest is a priest in the Anglican and Episcopal churches who is not the senior member of clergy of the parish to which they are appointed, but is nonetheless in priests' orders; there is no difference in function or theology, merely in 'grade' or 'rank'. Some assistant priests have a \"sector ministry\", that is to say that they specialize in a certain area of ministry within the local church, for example youth work, hospital work, or ministry to local light industry. They may also hold some diocesan appointment part-time. In most (though not all) cases, an assistant priest has the legal status ofassistant curate, although not all assistant curates are priests, as this legal status also applies to manydeaconsworking as assistants in a parochial setting.\n\nThe corresponding term in theCatholic Churchis \"parochial vicar\" – an ordained priest assigned to assist the pastor (Latin:parochus) of a parish in the pastoral care of parishioners. Normally, all pastors are also ordained priests; occasionally an auxiliary bishop will be assigned that role.\n\nInWicca, the leader of acovenor temple (either a high priestess or high priest) often appoints an assistant. This assistant is often called a 'deputy', but the more traditional terms 'maiden' (when female and assisting a high priestess) and 'summoner' (when male and assisting a high priest) are still used in many denominations.\n\nArchpriestBrahminGothiHieromonkJogi (caste)List of fictional clergy and religious figuresPresbyterorum Ordinis, decree on the priesthood from theSecond Vatican CouncilPriest shortageRitualism in the Church of EnglandSacerdotalismVicarVolkhv\n\nArchpriestBrahminGothiHieromonkJogi (caste)List of fictional clergy and religious figuresPresbyterorum Ordinis, decree on the priesthood from theSecond Vatican CouncilPriest shortageRitualism in the Church of EnglandSacerdotalismVicarVolkhv\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n## External links\n\n\nLook uppriestin Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\nLook uppriestin Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\nLook uppriestin Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related toPriests.\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related toPriests.\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related toPriests.\n\nWikiquote has quotations related toPriest.\n\nWikiquote has quotations related toPriest.\n\nWikiquote has quotations related toPriest.\n\nDescriptionof the problem of Roman Catholic and Old Catholic reunion with respect to the female priesthoodChisholm, Hugh, ed.

  "Tabula Capuana": "TheTabula Capuana(\"Tablet from Capua\";Ital.Tavola Capuana),is an ancientterracottaslab, 50 by 60 cm (20 by 24 in), with a long inscribed text inEtruscan, dated to around 470 BCE,apparently a ritualcalendar.About 390 words are legible, making it the second-most extensive surviving Etruscan text.The longest is the linen book(Liber Linteus), also a ritual calendar, used inancient Egyptformummywrappings, now atZagreb. The Tabula Capuana is located in theAltes Museum,Berlin.\n\nDescription\n\n\n## Description\n\n\nHorizontal scribed linesdivide the text into ten sections. The writing is most similar to that used inCampaniain the mid-5th century BC, though surely the text being transcribed is much older. The text is boustrophedon, with the first line to be read left to right, the next right to left, etc.\n\nAttempts at deciphering the text (Mauro Cristofani, 1995) are most generally based on the supposition that it prescribes certain rites on certain days of the year at certain places for certain deities. The ten visible sections seem to each be devoted to a different month, March through December, January and February presumably having been treated in the missing top sections. The text itself was edited by Francesco Roncalli, inScrivere etrusco, 1985.\n\nRecently, a major scholar in the field, Bouke van der Meer, has proposed a \"very tentative partial word-for-word translation\" of the text:\n\nText example\n\n\n## Text example\n\n\n(/ indicates line break; some word breaks are uncertain)\n\nFirst section (lines 1-7): MARCH?\n\n\n### First section (lines 1-7): MARCH?\n\n\nThe first legible section likely is devoted to rituals to be held in March (though the Etruscan word for this month,Velcitna, does not occur in the legible text, presumably because it was in the missing parts).\n\nThere are three to five initial lines missing and then 30-50 characters missing in the initial damaged lines shown here.\n\n...vacil.../2ai savcnes satiriasa.../3...[nunθ?]eri θuθcuvacil  śipir  śuri leθamsulci tartiria /4cim clevaac asri halχteivacil iceu  śuni savlasie...\n\n(~5-8 characters broken off at the end of this line)\n\n/5[mul]u rizile picasrisavlasieisvacil lunaśie vaca iχnacfuli/6nuśnesvacil savcnes itnamulu rizile picasriianevacil l/7eθamsul scuvunemarzac saca⋮\n\nNotes: \nIn line 1 and throughout,vacilmay mean \"libation\" (or some similar rite or ceremony), in which case each of the first phrases beginning with it presumably indicate what deity to pour a libation to and perhaps other information.However, Steinbauer (agreeing with Rix) has challenged this assumption and, considering that it seems to be positioned at the beginning of a series of phrases within the context of a step-by-step instruction, proposed thatvacil(with its variantsvacalandvacl) simply means \"then.\"\n\nIn line 2,savc-nesaccording to van der Meer is an Apolline god, perhaps related in form tosaucsaθat 3.15 of theLiber Linteus. The form in the Liber Linteus, preceded as here by the termvacl\"libation,\" also falls in a section that probably deals with March, though as here there is no explicit mention of a month name. The relevant text from that passage of the Liber Linteus is as follows (3.15-3.17):vacl . an . ścanince . saucsaθ . persin / cletram . śrenχve . iχ . ścanince . ciz . vacl / araroughly: \"The libation which was poured toSauc- Pers-(should be performed) with the decorated litter just as it had been poured (before); perform the libation three times.\"\n\nNote that the ending-nes/-nisalso occurs in the formsfulinuś-nes(5-6) andcaθ-nis(9), all referring to deities.\n\nIn line 2,satiriasa(if one word) may be a form ofSatrethe Etruscan term forSaturn, which also appears on thePiacenza Liveramong chthonic deities.Or it could be in some way connected to or contrasting withtartiriaat the end of line 3.\n\nIn line three,śuriis a (not necessarily exclusively) chthonic deity.The form also appears on theLead Plaque of Magliano.Leθam-sappears on thePiacenza Liveramong chthonic deities, but may have other connections as well. The genitive is used here as usual for indirect object.\n\nIn lines three and four,ci(m)means \"three,\" and bothtartiriaandclevaindicate kinds of offerings, yielding a possible partial translation: \"To Lethams, threetartiria(perhaps related to Greek Tartaros, as if '(gifts) for the underworld'?) offerings and threeclevaofferings ...\"In line 4,halχ-is likely the name of a kind of vase.\n\nA verbal form ofvacilmay be seen in line 5:vac-a\"make a libation (to)?\"; But van der Meer readsfacahere, with unknown meaning. A similar form,vac-iis in line 28, also preceding a form offuli/nuśnes.Also in line 5,lunaśiebrings to mind the Roman moon goddess,Luna(which some equate withCath, see below).pi-cas(ri)(5,6) is defined by Pallottino as a verb of offering, to be compared witha-cas\"to do; to offer.\"mulu-(4/5, 6) andscu-(7, 10) seem to be roots meaning \"to offer, give\" and \"finish\", respectively; andsac-means \"carry out a sacred act; consecrate.\"In lines 5-6,fuli/nuśnesmay be a form ofFufluns, the EtruscanDionysuswho is associated with the Etruscan goddessCaθawho also seems to be mentioned in this text (see below).A somewhat similar form,fuln[folnius]can be found on line 29 of theTabula Cortonensis.\n\nNote the frequent repetitions (besidesvacil):savcnes(2, 6);leθamsul(3, 6/7, 8...);mulu-ri zile picas-ri(4/5, 6, 18/19 but with...a-cas-rirather thanpi-cas-ri);savlasie(is)(4, 5);scu-vune marza(c)(7) versusmarza...scuvse(10)...\n\nThe tentative partial translation by van der Meer, building on the work of many others suggests this part of the ritual calendar calls for an indeterminate offering be made to the god Saucne, and that libations be performed for the godsŚuriand Letham as well as for the gods Saulasie and Fulinusne. Furthermore, that a giftedrizilebe accepted in [the period of?] Iana. And that, the libation to Letham having been properly completed, amarzabe consecrated.\n\nSecond section (starting on line 8): APRIL =apirase\n\n\n### Second section (starting on line 8): APRIL =apirase\n\n\nThe second section seems to be devoted to rituals to be held in April.\n\niśveitule ilucve apiraseleθamsul ilucu cuiesχu perpricipen apires /9racvanies huθ zuslerithnaitulteisnuza in te hamaiθiciveis caθnis fan/10irimarza in te hamaiθiital sacriutus ecunzaiiti alχuscuvse riθnaitu/11lteici zusle acun siricima nunθerieθ iśuma zuslevai apire nunθer/12iavθleθ aiumvacil ia leθamsul nunθerivacil ia riθnaitaeθ aθene/13ica perpricelutule apirase unialθi turza esχaθceei iśum unialθ ara/14epnicei nunθcu ciiei turzairiθnaita eiti ia halχapertule aφes ilucu vacil zuχn/15e...elφa riθnaitultraisvanec calus zusleva atu[unis]neinpa vinaiθ acasaφ/16esci tartiria ci turza riθnaitulasnenaziulastravaiuser hivus niθusc riθnaitulahivustravaiuser snenaziulas\n\nNotes: Line 8 shows the formisveiwhich occurs frequently in theLiber Linteuswhere it appears to mean \"festival\" or \"ides\". If the formiśumin line 13 is related, it may mean \"festive\" or (more likely) \"appropriate for a sacred festival\" > \"sacred.\" The formtul(e)(8, 9, 10) in some contexts means \"stone\", perhaps related totular\"border\" (< \"stone marking a border\"?),itself probably related to (or the origin of?) Umbriantuder\"boundary\"; also the origin of the Umbrian town name Todi.Here it seems to mean \"(on or after) the ides (of a particular month).\"According to van der Meer,iluc-ve/u(twice in line 8) means \"feast.\"Of course,iśveiandtulecan't both mean \"ides\", and in any case, the Latinidesoriginally fell on the full moon and was sacred to Jupiter, but since the deities recognizable here are underworld (leθamsandcaθ),tulmay instead refer to the dark phase of the moon, or the new moon (Latinkalends). As van der Meer points out elaborately elsewhere, the contrast between light and dark gods was very important for the Etruscan calendar and for how they divided up the heavens.\n\napirasemay mean \"(in the) month of April.\"See above forLeθam-sul.

  "Tages": "This articlerelies excessively onreferencestoprimary sources.Please improve this article by addingsecondary or tertiary sources.Find sources:\"Tages\"–news·newspapers·books·scholar·JSTOR(December 2019)(Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nTageswas claimed as a foundingprophetofEtruscan religionwho is known from reports by Latin authors of the lateRoman RepublicandRoman Empire. He revealed a cosmic view of divinity and correct methods of ascertaining divine will concerning events of public interest. Suchdivinationwas undertaken in Roman society by priestly officials calledharuspices.\n\nThereligious textsrecording the revelations of Tages (and a few other prophets, mainly a female figure known asVegoia) were called by the Romans theEtrusca Disciplinaat least as early as the late republic. They were written in theEtruscan language, despite their Latin titles. None presently survive. The last author claiming to have read elements of thedisciplinais the sixth-centuryJohn the Lydian, writing atConstantinople.Thus, knowledge of Tages comes mainly from what is said about him by the classical authors, which is a legendary and quasimythical view; John the Lydian suggested Tages is only a parable.\n\nAs theEtruscan alphabethad no 'G', Tages is most likely a Latinization of an Etruscan word. The reverse of a third-centuryBCbronze mirror fromTuscaniadepicts a youthfulharuspexin a conical hat examining a liver. He is labeledpavatarchies. A second, olderharuspexwith a beard listens and is labeledavl tarchunus.Massimo Pallottinomade the generally accepted suggestion that the first name is to be segmentedpava Tarchiesand means \"the child, Tarchies.\" The second name is \"the son of Tarchon\", where Tarchon is the legendary king ofTarquinia, location of Tages' revelation, and also one of the founders of the Etruscan League.\n\nGm. M. Facchetti proposed an alternative hypothesis linking the name to the repetitive Etruscan stem thac-/thax, which he interprets as 'voice'.\n\nThere are multiple versions of the origins of Tages.Broadly Tages appeared from the earth while an Etruscan was ploughing, and then taught Etruscansdivination. He is sometimes the grandson ofJove.Ciceroreports the myth in this way:\n\nThey tell us that one day as the land was being ploughed in the territory ofTarquinii, and a deeper furrow than usual was made, suddenly Tages sprang out of it and addressed the ploughman.  Tages, as it is recorded in the works of the Etrurians (Libri Etruscorum), possessed the visage of a child, but the prudence of a sage.  When the ploughman was surprised at seeing him, and in his astonishment made a great outcry, a number of people assembled around him, and before long all the Etrurians came together at the spot. Tages then discoursed in the presence of an immense crowd, who noted his speech and committed it to writing. The information they derived from this Tages was the foundation of the science of the soothsayers (haruspicinae disciplina), and was subsequently improved by the accession of many new facts, all of which confirmed the same principles. We received this record from them. This record is preserved in their sacred books, and from it the augurial discipline is deduced.\n\nInOvid's version,Tyrrhenus arator(\"a Tyrrhenian ploughman\") observed a clod turn into a man and begin to speak of things destined to happen and how the Etruscan people could discover the future.\n\nEtrusca disciplina\n\n\n## Etrusca disciplina\n\n\nJoannes Laurentius Lyduslived in the sixth centuryAD. Although the last classical-period writer to have read the books, he is the most specific about his sources. He impliesthat he read \"the texts of the Etruscans\"; that is, theEtrusca Disciplina, including the report of theharuspex,Tarchon, who was instructed byTyrrhenus. Tarchon's work on Tages, he says, is a dialogue in which Tarchon asks Tages questions in \"the ordinary language of the Italians\". This is presumablyVulgar Latin, as Lydus cannot mean any early Italic dialect. Tages' recorded response is \"in ancient letters\", presumably in theEtruscan language. Lydus says it is not very understandable, and that he relies on translations.\n\nRepresentations of Tages\n\n\n## Representations of Tages\n\n\nLabeled Etruscan representations of Tages are very rare, and scenes clearly tied to the Tages myth are almost as rare. Figures leaning on thelituus, the crooked staff of theaugur, or examining entrails wearing the conical cap of theharuspex, are common, but are not necessarily Tages. Winged figures, representing divinity, are also common, especially on funerary urns fromTarquinia, but whether any depict Tages is questionable. Assuming that a certain percentage of these representations are, in fact, Tages, there appears to be no standard way to depict him. Art historians have inserted Tages freely among them but entirely in a speculative fashion.\n\nIn addition to the labelled scene on the bronze mirror described above, which must have been repeated many times without labels, a type of scene engraved on fourth-centuryBCgemstones, once set in seal rings, appears to describe the Tages myth. A bearded figure (Tarchon?) bends over as though listening at the head or head and torso of another, beardless figure embedded in or arising from the ground.On a similar theme is a third-century BC bronze votive statuette, .327 m (1.07 ft) high, from Tarquinia, of a sitting infant peering upward with an adult's head and visage.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nThomson De Grummond, Nancy; Simon, Erika, eds.

  "Tinia": "Tinia(alsoTin,Tinh,TinsorTina) was thesky godand the highest deity inEtruscan religion, equivalent to theRomanJupiterand theGreekZeus.\n\nHowever, a primary source from the Roman Varro states thatVeltha, not Tins, was the supreme deity of the Etruscans.This has led some scholars to conclude that they were assimilated, but this is speculation.\n\nTinia was the husband ofUniand the father ofHercle. Like many other Etruscan deities, his name isgender neutral.\n\nTheEtruscanshad a group of nine gods who had the power of hurling thunderbolts; they were calledNovensilesby theRomans.Of thunderbolts there were eleven sorts, of which Tinia wielded three.\n\nTinia was sometimes represented with a beard or sometimes as youthful and beardless.In terms ofsymbolism, Tinia has thethunderbolt.Tinia's thunderbolts could be red or blood coloured.\n\nLikeSelvansand possiblyLaran,Tinia also protected boundaries. His name appears as the guarantor on three boundary stones with identical inscriptions found inTunisia, originally placed there by the Etruscan colonists.\n\nSome of Tinia's possibleepithetsare detailed on thePiacenza Liver, a bronze model of a liver used forharuspicy. These inscriptions have been transcribed asTin Cilens,Tin ΘufandTinś Θne.

  "Turan (mythology)": "Turanwas theEtruscangoddessof love, fertility and vitality and patroness of the city ofVelch.\n\nIn art, Turan was usually depicted as a young winged girl.Turan appears in toilette scenes of Etruscan bronze mirrors. She is richly robed and jeweled in early and late depictions, but appears nude under the influence ofHellenistic artin the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE.She is paired with her young lover  Atunis (Adonis) and figures in the episode of theJudgement of Paris.\n\nAttributes\n\n\n## Attributes\n\n\nTuran was commonly associated with birds such as thedove,gooseand above all theswan,Tusna, \"the swan of Turan\".Herretinuewere calledLasas. Turan may be quite ancient but does not appear on the Piacenza list nor inMartianuslist of Etruscan deities. The Etruscan month of July was named after her, although we only know the Latin word for it,Traneus.\n\nTuran was seen as the equivalent tothe RomanVenusand theGreekAphrodite. Her name is the pre-Hellenic root of \"Turannos\" (absolute ruler, seetyrant),so Turan can be viewed as “Mistress\".\n\nTuran had a sanctuary in the Greek-influencedGravisca, the port forTarquinia, wherevotive giftsinscribed with her name have been found. One inscription calls herTuran ati, \"Mother Turan\" which has been interpreted as connecting her toVenus Genetrix, Venus the mother ofAeneasand progenitor of theJulio-Claudianlineage.\n\nTuran is one of the few Etruscan goddesses who has survived into Italian folklore fromRomagna. Called \"Turanna\", she is said to be a fairy, a spirit of love and happiness, who helps lovers.\n\nExternal links\n\n\n## External links\n\n\nMedia related toTuran (dea)at Wikimedia Commonshttp://www.thaliatook.com/OGOD/turan.html",
  "Turms": "InEtruscan religion,Turms(usually written as 𐌕𐌖𐌓𐌌𐌑Turmśin theEtruscan alphabet) was the equivalent of RomanMercuryand GreekHermes, both gods of \ntrade and the messenger god between people and gods.He was depicted with the same distinctive attributes as Hermes and Mercury: acaduceus, apetasos(often winged), and/or winged sandals.He is portrayed as a messenger of the gods, particularlyTinia(Jupiter),although he is also thought to be ‘at the service’ (ministerium) of other deities.\n\nEtruscan artwork often depicts Turms in his role aspsychopomp, conducting the soul into the afterlife.In this capacity he is sometimes shown on Etruscan sarcophagi—in one case side by side withCharunandCerberus.In another depiction, in which the god is labelled as 𐌕𐌖𐌓𐌌𐌑 𐌀𐌉𐌕𐌀𐌑Turmś Aitaśor ‘Turms ofHades’, he brings the shade ofTiresiasto consult withOdysseusin the underworld.Turms also appears in images depicting theJudgement of Paris,as well as in scenes withHercle(Heracles) orPerseus.\n\nThe nameTurmsis of distinctivelyEtruscanorigin, like that ofFuflunsbut in contrast to deities such as Hercle andApulu(Apollo), whose names were borrowed fromGreek.\n\nTurms is known more from decoration on everyday objects, such as mirrors, than from cult images,although one dedication has been taken to indicate the existence of a temple of Turms atCortona.\n\nBernard Combet-Farnoux interprets comments byServiusandMacrobiusas indicating that “Hermes-Turms” had theepithetCamillus, meaning ‘servant’ (i.e. of the other deities).AscholiumonCallimachusadds that “Cadmilosis Hermes inTyrrhenia”; Combet-Farnoux considers Camillus and Cadmilos to be variants of the same name.\n\nTurms is also the name of a character in a historical novel byMika Waltari,The Etruscan, which takes place during the end ofEtruscan civilization.\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n### Works cited\n\n\nCombet-Farnoux, Bernard (1980). \"Turms étrusque et la fonction de «minister» de l'Hermès italique\".Mercure romain : Le culte public de Mercure et la fonction mercantile à Rome de la République archaïque à l'époque augustéenne.

  "Uni (mythology)": "Uniis the ancientgoddessof marriage, fertility, family, and women inEtruscan religionand myth, and was the patron goddess ofPerugia. She is identified as theEtruscanequivalent ofJunoinRoman mythology, andHerainGreek mythology.As the supreme goddess of theEtruscan pantheon, she is part of the Etruscan trinity, an original precursor to theCapitoline Triad,made up of her husbandTinia, the god of the sky, and daughterMenrva, the goddess of wisdom.\n\nShe is often depicted with a goatskin cloak and sandals whilst holding a shield, similarly toJuno Sospita,wearing a bridal veil, or completely nude.\n\nLivystates (Book V,Ab Urbe Condita) that Juno was anEtruscangoddess of theVeientes, who was adopted ceremonially into the Roman pantheon when Veii was sacked in 396 BC. This seems to refer to Uni. She also appears on theLiver of Piacenza.\n\nThe name Uni is of uncertain etymology, however may be related to an Indo-European rootiunimeaning \"young\",connecting to her association with fertility, love, and marriage. In relation, it has also been suggested that the LatinIuno(Juno) originated from Etruscan, changed from a feminine-iEtruscan ending.\n\nAs most of Etruscan literature has not survived through time, mythological stories involving the Etruscan gods have been largely interpreted through engraved scenes in bronze mirrors,and other mixed media artworks.\n\nUni and Hercle\n\n\n### Uni and Hercle\n\n\nA notable mirror fromVolterradepicts Uni nursing an adult demigodHercle(the GreekHeraclesor RomanHercules).Tinia, amongst other gods present at the scene, points to a tablet with the inscription indicating the significance of the event:\"eca: sren: tva: iχnac hercle:unial clan: θra:sce\"meaning \"this picture shows how Hercle became Uni's son\".In other depictions of this myth, deities such as Menrva,Turan, and Mean - the goddess of victory - are present as part of an animated crowd bearing witness to the adoption.\n\nThe motif of Hercle suckling Uni is understood as holdingGreekorigins, where counterpart Hera was unknowingly deceived byZeus(Tinia) into nursing, and by that process adopting, an infant Heracles against her will.\n\nDepiction of this myth in which the adoption process features an adult Hercle, and an obliging Uni is widely acknowledged as having developed entirely in Etruria.Most scholars view this interpretation of the myth as the Hercle's welcome initiation to godhood; it has also been suggested that the scene represents Uni and Hercle's reconciliation, where the Etruscan recount accurately represents the meaning of Hercle's Greek name \"Glory of Hera\".\n\nBronze mirror from Volterra.Bronze mirror depicting Uni nursing Hercle, featuring Tinia, Menrva, Turan, and Mean.Uni nursing Hercle, from Tomb 65, Tarquina.Detail of inscription on bronze mirror from Volterra, pointed to by Tinia.\n\nThe Judgement of Elcsntre\n\n\n### The Judgement of Elcsntre\n\n\nThe Judgement of Elcsntre (equivalently known in Greek terms as theJudgement of Paris) is secondarily notable as a myth often represented on Etruscan terms through bronze mirrors. The major themes of the Greek myth remain intact; Elcsntre (Parisor Alexander = Elcsntre), as guided byTurms(Hermes), must choose who is ‘the fairest’ between Menrva, Uni, andTuran(Aphrodite) to be the recipient of a gifted egg(golden apple) which had been presented at the wedding ofPeleusandThetis. Where Elcsntre could not easily choose between the three goddesses, they then resorted to bribing him. Etruscan interpretation of the specific offerings presented is not clear due to the lack of written sources, and various different representations on a number of mirrors, however there are common representations of Menrva's and Turan's gifts in alignment with their Greek counterparts. Menrva's spear and a wreathare often depicted, as representative of offered glory in battle. Turan is often depicted holding branches of flowers and displaying her body,representative of her offering to Elcsntre the most beautiful women in the world as his wife. Uniquely, Uni is depicted in a different manner which does not entirely correspond to the Greek origin of the myth. Amongst different mirrors, she has been depicted as being nude,or fully clothed but holding a pomegranate branch with three pieces of fruit,which has generally not been interpreted as the offering of political power from the Greek myth. Instead rather while there is no clear assertion of her offering, it has been argued that these depictions demonstrate her unique Etruscan characteristics where she is more greatly associated with the fruits of fertility.\n\nBronze mirror depicting the Judgement of Elcsntre. Figures from left to right: Elcsntre, Uni, Menrva, unknown.Bronze mirror depicting the Judgement of Elcsntre. Figures from left to right: Elscntre, Menrva, Turan, Althaia. A chariot is being drawn in the upper extremities of the mirror, and the lower extremities feature Vile strangling serpents.\n\nUni, alongside Tinia and Menrva, acts as one of the three deities which make up the Etruscan Trinity, equivalent to the RomanCapitoline Triad. Most scholars agree that this triad was imported by theRomansfrom original Etruscan custom, where Uni and Menrva traditionally played larger roles than their counterparts Juno and Minerva.Ancient sources have described the expectation of towns to dedicate temples to Tinia, Uni, and Menrva at the end of three roads, leading to three gates, as a part ofEtrusca disciplina.Further, it was suggested byVitruviusthat these such temples should have been located on the most elevated sites of the town, and spread apart from one another.\n\nUni was worshipped both individually at dedicated shrines, and alongside other deities as part of large public sanctuaries throughout Etruria. Established cults to Uni worshipped her status as a supreme goddess of family and reproduction.\n\nShrine at Pyrgi\n\n\n### Shrine at Pyrgi\n\n\nAs part of a large Tuscan style temple, the north-located shrine atPyrgidedicated to Uni was built in approximately 500 BC,and neighboured a smallerGreek temple. Compared to other locations, the cult of worship dedicated to Uni at Pyrgi held close resemblance to traditional Greek worship sanctuaries; at least 300votive objectswere dedicated there, alongside animal bones suggestive of sacrifice.Additionally, two bowls made by the Etruscan Spurinas designatedvotato Uni alongside Tinia andThesan.\n\nThreegold plaqueswere excavated from the site in 1964, two written in Etruscan, and one inPhoenecian. The two longer Etruscan and Phoenecian inscriptions clarify the dedication of the temple was tounialastresas the genitive form ofuni-astre, an amalgamated goddess of the Etruscan Uni asuniand PhoenecianAstarteasastre.The dedication came from the ruler ofCaere, in gratitude for her support of his reign.The shorter of the Etruscan inscriptions outlines distinct annual rituals which took place to ensure the ongoing purity of the temple.\n\nSanctuary at Gravisca\n\n\n### Sanctuary at Gravisca\n\n\nAt the port ofGraviscain the 6th century BC, Uni was worshipped amongst other Etruscan and pan-Hellenic deities in a large network of sanctuaries. Dedication to Uni was aggregated in a singular room at the sanctuary in the southern area of the complex.Nearby, a similar room was dedicated individually toTuran.Both rooms featured statuettes of swaddled babies, and a myriad of votive anatomical dedications such as breasts and uteri.There is little difference between type of votive offering presented to Uni and Turan, however the numbers of these votives differentiate the rooms comparatively; 145 votive uteri were excavated from Uni's dedicated sanctuary, compared to the 74 recovered from Turan's.Additionally, 22 swaddled babies were found dedicated to Uni, where two were found dedicated to Turan. Both sanctuaries featured two votive breasts.It has been suggested that this difference could represent specialisation of offerings.\n\nPoggio Colla\n\n\n### Poggio Colla\n\n\nAn Etruscan sanctuary atPoggio Colla, located near the town ofVicchioin theMugelloregion of northernTuscany, was part of an ongoing archaeological project run from 1995 until 2015 by the Mugello Valley Archaeological Project and Poggio Colla Field School (PCFS). Excavations over the 21-season project potentially suggested Uni as the nominal deity of the area, with the uncovering of a bucchero vase depicting a, potentially sacred, birth scene, ritual behaviour at west of the sanctuary's network, and other dedications made by women.In 2015, the Vicchio Stele was excavated from a temple on site, and recovered as one of the longest recorded sacred Etruscan texts thus far.The date extrapolated from letter-forms and punctuation, and the place in which it was found link the stele to have being presented at the sanctuary in its “phase 0” of architectural history;this phase predated stone architecture, and was characterised by huts.Inscriptions on the edges of the stele were written in a form of “pseudo-boustrophedon”,and potentially have up to 200 letters. Around 120 of these are legible.Etruscan archaeologist Adriano Maggiani has dated the inscription as being from 525 to 510 BCE., right before the building of the foundations in which it was placed\n\nTranslation of thesteleis incomplete, but from preliminary readings, scholars have tentatively linked a reference to Uni, based on the way the stele was placed in the foundations of the temple,and where it may mention a goddess presiding over birth, potentially connecting her as the patron divinity of the cult at Poggio Colla, along with brief mention of her consort Tinia.Part of the text which has been deciphered seems to display requirements of practice for the cult, demanding two objects of something for Tinia, “in the place of Uni”.\n\nArcheologists have stated that \"The centre of worship was an underground fissure that was ritually treated after the destruction of the temple,\" and that. \"Underground cults of this type were often associated with female divinities.\"The university of Florence is currently undertaking the process of 3D documentation of the Vicchio Stele in order to create a more complete reconstruction of the entire text.\n\nRegional placement in Heaven\n\n\n## Regional placement in Heaven\n\n\nIn a practice that has been argued by scholars as having originated in Etruria,Etrusca disciplina divided the Heavens into sixteen different cosmological regions.Reflected in thePiacenza Liver, deities were assigned respective ‘houses’ where labels were inscribed into the sixteen sections of the bronze work. Etruscan temples held no unified orientation; temples dedicated to Uni have commonly been found to be oriented southwest, and dedications to Tinia oriented south, unlike Greek temples which have been found to all be usually directed east.It is clear that the placements of deities in the Liver of Piacenza held influence over orientation and places of worship, however there has been some debate towards interpretation of the plate. Two predominant schools of thought have largely dominated readings of the regions of the Liver, however a third theory which somewhat reconciles the two mutually exclusive views has emerged as suggested by Stevens. This theory demonstrates Uni's placement in heavenly region number four as flexible with the seasons and in alignment with the difference in sunset and sunrise positions throughout the year.Where the temple of Fontanile di Legnisina dedicated to Uni found in Vulci, is located in the fixed terrestrial region number 10, and its entrance is opposite to region number 2 rather than 4, the non-corresponding position by two regions is explained by this theory of a “rotating Etruscan heaven”.Similarly, at Pyrgi, the orientation of a temple belonging to Uni is southeast. This positioning places it in fixed terrestrial regions 10 and 11 where opposite to the entrance, Uni's heavenly region number 4 is still evident in the terrestrial region number 2 to allow for seasonal fluctuation.\n\nCapitoline TriadPyrgi TabletsLiver of Piacenza\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n## External links\n\n\nMedia related toUni (goddess)at Wikimedia Commons",

  "Vegoia": "Vegoia(Etruscan:Vecu) is asibyl, prophet, ornymphwithin theEtruscan religious frameworkwho is identified as the author of parts of their large and complex set of sacred books, detailing the religiously correct methods of founding cities and shrines, draining fields, formulating laws and ordinances, measuring space and dividing time; she initiated the Etruscan people to the arts, as originating the rules and rituals of land marking, and as presiding over the observance, respect, and preservation of boundaries. Vegoia also is known asVecu,Vecui, andVecuvia,as well asVegoe; her name is also given asBegoeorBigois.\n\nIn the Etruscan religious framework\n\n\n## In the Etruscan religious framework\n\n\nTheEtruscan religious systemremains mostly obscure. There being few bilingual documents comparable to theRosetta Stonethat could facilitate translation, the Etruscan language is poorly understood. Therefore, the existing ancient Etruscan documents of the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries BCE that would reveal their religious concepts, do not yield much. Moreover, during the later period of the fifth through the first centuries BCE, Etruscan civilization heavily absorbed elements of Greek civilization and eventually, it was diluted in the Greco-Roman cultural mix with their powerful Roman neighbors. Lastly, while the Etruscans formalized their religious concepts and practices in a series of \"sacred books\", most no longer exist and they are known only through commentaries or quotes by Roman authors of the late first century,and hence, may be biased.\n\nTwo mythological figures have been set by the Etruscans as presiding over the writing of their sacred books: Vegoia, the subject of this article, andTages, a monstrous childlike figure gifted with the knowledge and prescience of an ancient sage. Those books are known from Latin authors under a classification pertaining to their content according to their mythological author (whether delivered through speeches or lectures, such asTages, or inspiration).\n\nThe attributes of Vegoia\n\n\n## The attributes of Vegoia\n\n\nThe figure of Vegoia is almost entirely blurred in the mists of the past. She is known mostly from the traditions of the Etruscan city of Chiusi (Latin: Clusium; Etruscan: Clevsin; Umbrian: Camars) (now in the province of Siena). The revelations of the prophetess Vegoia are designated as theLibri Vegoicithat included theLibri Fulguralesand part of theLibri Rituales, especially theLibri Fatales.\n\nShe is barely designated as a \"nymph\" and as the author of theLibri Fulgurales,that give the keys to interpreting the meaning of lightning strokes sent by the deities using a cartography of the sky that, as a sort of property division and use assignment, is attributed to Vegoia.Her assignment of sectors of the horizon to various deities is paralleled in the microcosm that is interpreted using the liver of a sacrificed animal. The sacred divisions also seem to have a correspondence in the measurement and division of land that, since the very dawn of Etruscan history, obeyed religious rules.Her dictates taught the correct methods of measuring space.\n\nVegoia also was depicted as lording over the observation of these rules, to be upheld under threat of dire woe or malediction.Thus, she was established as the power presiding over land property and land property rights, laws, and contracts (as distinct from commercial contract laws).\n\nShe also is indicated as having established the laws relative to hydraulic works,thus having a special relationship to \"tamed\" water.\n\nInfluence of Etruscan sacred books\n\n\n## Influence of Etruscan sacred books\n\n\nThis imposing system of \"revealing\" and \"sacred texts\" left a significant imprint on the neighboring Italic peoples. There is ample evidence of theEtruscan culturehaving heavily permeated the less-advanced communities of their Latin and Sabine neighbours. For example, the Etruscan alphabet that was derived from the Greek one, is solidly established as having inspired the Latin alphabet. The principles and structural rules of theEtruscan decimal numeral system, likewise, are recognized as the origin of the Roman numerals that are a simplified version of theEtruscan system. Similarly derived are the symbols of supreme power (seeEtruscan civilization), the structure of theRoman calendar,and the EtruscanCraeciis the source for the word \"Greeks\" (who self-identified asHellenes), etc.\n\nRelationship to Sibylline books\n\n\n### Relationship to Sibylline books\n\n\nWhile the Roman religion has precious little written basis, they nonetheless had a very abstruse set of texts known as theSibylline Booksthat were under the exclusive control of special religious figures, theduumviri(thendecemviri). The books were resorted to solely in times of ultimate crisis. The devolution of these \"sacred books\" to the Romans through a rocambolesque scene, was attributed to an Etruscan,Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the legendary kings of Rome. Hence, their relationship to Vegoia.\n\nRelationship to Egeria\n\n\n## Relationship to Egeria\n\n\nLikewise, one may suspect that the legend ofEgeriais related to Vegoia. Egeria is the name of the nymph who inspired the second legendary king of Rome,Numa Pompilius(in Latin, \"numen\" designates \"the expressed will of a deity\"),who succeeded its founder, Romulus, when she dictated to him the rules that established the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome that also are associated with \"sacred books\".\n\nNuma is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in \"sacred books\" that he caused to be buried with him. According toPlutarch, when a chance accident brought them back to light some 500 years later, the books were deemed by the Roman Senate to be inappropriate for disclosure to the people and they ordered that the books be destroyed.What made these sacred books 'inappropriate' was certainly of a \"political\" nature, but precisely what that was, had not been handed down byValerius Antias, the source thatPlutarchwas using. However, sacred books were the source used to interpret the abstruse omens of deities (episode of the omen fromFaunus). Sacred books also were associated with beneficial water, which also would have been linked to Vegoia.\n\nList of Etruscan mythological figures\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n\nDumézil, Georges (2000) [1974]. \"appendice sur la religion des Etrusques\".La religion romaine archaïque[The Archaic Roman Religion] (in French).

  "Villanovan culture": "TheVillanovan culture(c.900–700 BCE), regarded as the earliest phase of theEtruscan civilization,was the earliestIron Ageculture ofItaly. It directly followed theBronze AgeProto-Villanovan culturewhich branched off from theUrnfield cultureofCentral Europe.The name derives from the locality of Villanova, a fraction of the municipality ofCastenasoin theMetropolitan City of Bolognawhere, between 1853 and 1855,Giovanni Gozzadinifound the remains of a necropolis, bringing to light 193 tombs, of which there were 179 cremations and 14 inhumations.\n\nThe Villanovans introduced iron-working to theItalian Peninsula. They practicedcremationand buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of distinctive double-cone shape.\n\nThe nameVillanovanof the early phases of the Etruscan civilization comes from the site of the first archaeological finds relating to this advanced culture, which were remnants of a cemetery found nearVillanova(Castenaso, 12 kilometres east ofBologna) innorthern Italy. The excavation lasting from 1853 to 1855 was done by the scholar and site owner, countGiovanni Gozzadini, and involved 193 tombs, six of which were separated from the rest as if to signify a special social status. The \"well tomb\" pit graves lined with stones containedfunerary urns. These had been only sporadically plundered and most were untouched. In 1893, a chance discovery unearthed another distinctive Villanovan necropolis atVerucchiooverlooking theAdriaticcoastal plain.\n\nThe burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central EuropeanUrnfield culture(c.1300–750 BCE) and CelticHallstatt culturethat succeeded the Urnfield culture. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Cremated remains were placed incinerary urns, specifically in biconical urnsand then buried. The urns were a form of Villanovan pottery known asimpasto.A custom believed to originate with the Villanovan culture is the usage of hut-shaped urns, which were cinerary urns fashioned like the huts in which the villagers lived. Typicalsgraffitodecorations ofswastikas,meanders, andsquareswere scratched with a comb-like tool. Urns were accompanied by simple bronzefibulae, razors and rings.\n\nPeriodization\n\n\n## Periodization\n\n\nThe Villanovan culture is broadly divided intoVillanovan Ifromc.960 BCEtoc.801 BCEand theVillanovan IIfromc.800 BCEto 720 BCE. The later phase (Villanovan II) saw radical changes, evidence of contact with Hellenic civilization and trade with the north along theAmber Road. This evidence takes the form of glass andambernecklaces for women, armor and horse harness fittings ofbronze, and the development of elite graves in contrast to the earlier egalitarian culture.Chamber tombs and inhumation (burial) practices were developed side-by-side with the earliercremationpractices. With the last phase of Villanovan II the Etruscans, in particularSouthern Etruria, entered theOrientalizing period. The northernmost areas of the Etruscan world, such as Etruria Padana, continued in their development asVillanovan III(750–680 BCE)  andVillanovan IV(680–540 BCE).\n\nVillanovan chronology within the Etruscan civilization\n\n\n### Villanovan chronology within the Etruscan civilization\n\n\nMetalwork and trade\n\n\n## Metalwork and trade\n\n\nThe metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery demonstrate the skill of the Villanovan artisans. Some grave goods from burial sites display an even higher quality, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture. Tools and items were placed in graves suggesting a belief in an afterlife. Men's graves contained weapons, armor, while those for women included weaving tools. A few graves switched or mixed these, indicating the possibility that some women employed tools and that some men made clothing.\n\nDuring the Villanovan period Etruscans traded with other states from the Mediterranean such as Greeks, Balkans, and Sardinia. Trade brought about advancement in metallurgy, and Greek presence influenced Villanovan pottery.\n\nBuildings were rectangular in shape. The people lived in small huts, made of wattle and daub with wooden poles for support. Within the huts, cooking stands, utensils and charred animal bones give evidence about the family life of early inhabitants in Italy.Some huts contained large pottery jars for food storage sunk into their floors. There was also a rock cut drain to channel rainwater to communal reservoirs.\n\nVillanovan settlements\n\n\n## Villanovan settlements\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Villanovan settlements were centered in the AdriaticEtruria, inEmilia Romagna(in particular, inBolognaand inVerucchio, nearRimini), inMarche(Fermo), and in the Tyrrhenian Etruria, inTuscanyandLazio. Further south, Villanovan cremation burials are to be found inCampania, atCapua, at the \"princely tombs\" ofPontecagnanonearSalerno,at Capo di Fiume, atVallo di Dianoand atSala Consilina.\n\nSmall scattered Villanovan settlements have left few traces other than their more permanent burial sites, which were set somewhat apart from the settlements—largely because the settlement sites were built over in Etruscan times. Modern opinion generally followsMassimo Pallottinoin regarding the Villanovan culture as ancestral to theEtruscan civilization.\n\nA genetic study published inSciencein November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Villanovan culture buried inVeio Grotta Gramiccia, Italy between ca. 900 BCE and 800 BCE. She carried the maternal haplogroupK1a4,found all over Europe since Neolithic times,and her autosomal DNA was a mixture of 72.9%Copper Ageancestry (EEF+WHG) and 27.1%Steppe-related ancestry.There was evidence for consanguinity for this sample with another ancient sample (700 BCE - 600 BCE) from the Etruscan necropolis of La Mattonara nearCivitavecchia, compatible with being the latter an offspring of third-degree relatives from the former.\n\nDecorative disk (chest guard), bronze, Italy, 8th century BC.

  "Votive offering": "Avotive offeringorvotive depositis one or more objects displayed or deposited, without the intention of recovery or use, in asacredplace forreligiouspurposes. Such items are a feature of modern and ancient societies and are generally made to gain favor withsupernaturalforces.\n\nIn Buddhism, votive offering such as construction ofstupaswas a prevalent practice in Ancient India, an example of which can be observed in the ruins of the ancientVikramshila Universityand other contemporary structures. Votive offerings have been described in historical Roman era and Greek sources, although similar acts continue into the present day—for example, in traditionalCatholic cultureand, arguably, in the modern-daypractice of tossing coinsinto awishing wellor fountain. The modern construction practice oftopping outcan be considered an example of a votive practice with ancient roots.\n\nInarchaeology, votive deposits differ fromhoards; although they may contain similar items, votive deposits were not intended to be recovered.\n\nAncient offerings\n\n\n## Ancient offerings\n\n\nInEurope, votive deposits are known from as early as theNeolithic, with polishedaxehoards, reaching a peak in the lateBronze Age. High statusartifactssuch as armor and weaponry (mostlyshields,swords,spearsand arrows), fertility andcultsymbols, coins, various treasures and animal statuettes (often dogs, oxen and in later periods horses) were common offerings in antiquity.\n\nThe votive offerings were sacrificed and buried or more commonly cast into bodies of water or peatbogs, whence they could not possibly have been recovered. In certain cases entire ships have been sacrificed, as in the Danish bogNydam Mose. Often all the objects in a ritual hoard are broken, possibly 'killing' the objects to put them even further beyond utilitarian use before deposition. The purposeful discarding of valuable items such as swords and spearheads is thought to have had ritual overtones. The items have since been discovered in rivers, lakes and present or formerwetlandsby construction workers, peat diggers, metal-detectorists, members of the public and archaeologists.\n\nA saying byDiogenes of Sinopeas quoted byDiogenes Laërtius, indicates the high level of votive offering in Ancient Greece:\n\nWhen some one expressed astonishment at the votive offerings inSamothrace, his (Diogenes) comment was,'There would have been far more, if those who were not saved had set up offerings.'\n\nTheTreasuries at OlympiaandDelphi(including theAthenian TreasuryandSiphnian Treasury) were buildings by the various Greek city-states to hold their own votive offerings in money and precious metal. The sites also contained large quantities of votive sculptures, although these were clearly intended to glorify each city in view of its rivals as well as to give thanks to the gods. Votive offerings were also used as atonement for sins committed against a god or goddess. The offerings were in certain cases created by a separate person due to the gifter having an injury or other circumstances, which was allowed.\n\nSome Greek offerings, such as bronze tripods atDelphi, were apparently displayed for a period and then buried in groups. AtOlympiamany small figurines, mostly of animals, were thrown onto the huge pile of ashes fromanimal sacrificesat the altar outside theTemple of Zeus. Much of our knowledge ofancient Greek artin base metal comes from these and other excavated deposits of offerings. Arms and armour, especially helmets, were also given after a victory.\n\nInMesoamerica, votive deposits have been recovered from theOlmecsite ofEl Manati(dated to 1600–1200 BC) and theMayaSacred CenoteatChichen Itza(850–1550 AD).\n\nArchaeologists have recovered some votive offerings in ancient Sparta from the 5th century BC. These votive offerings give evidence to the presence of literacy in Spartan culture. Placing greater emphasis on inscriptions which seem to have been made by the individual making the offering, archaeologists can interpret that, of the early dedicators, there were very few in number and that most, if not all, were from the upper classes. One piece of pottery was found that may have had measurement signs on it. This would indicate an everyday literacy among the Spartans if this is true. Unfortunately, scholars have not recovered any other piece of pottery with a similar inscription to support that single find.\n\nThe 13 AncientVotive Stones of Pesarowere unearthed in 1737 on a localPesarofarm in theProvince of Pesaro e Urbino,Italy, and date to pre-Etruscan times. They are inscribed with the names of variousRoman godssuch asAPOLLO,MAT[ER]-MATVTA,SALVS,FIDE, and IVNONII (Juno).\n\nCurse tablets\n\n\n### Curse tablets\n\n\nAcurse tabletordefixiois a small sheet of tin or lead on which a message wishing misfortune upon someone else was inscribed. Usually found rolled up and deliberately deposited, there are five main reasons for dedicating a curse tablet:\n\n1– Litigation,2– Competition,3– Trade,4– Erotic Ambition,5– Theft\n\nOf those in Britain the vast majority are of type 5. The two largest concentrations are from the sacred springs atAquae Sulis, where 130 examples are recorded, and at Uley, where over 140 examples are visible.\nThe use of the curse-tablet in seeking restoration of stolen property is strong evidence of invoking divine power through a non-traditional religious ceremony, often involving some form of water-deposition. The usual form of divine invocation was through prayer, sacrifice and altar dedicationso access to this information provides useful insights into Roman provincial culture.\n\nMany unrecovered ancient votive offerings are threatened in today's world, especially those submerged in wetlands or other bodies of water. Wetlands and other aquatic sites often protect and preserve materials for thousands of years, because of their natural occurringanaerobicenvironments. However, many seabeds have been disturbed, rivers and streams have been stretched out or re-routed in the landscape, and many wetlands have been fully or partially drained or landfilled for various reasons in the last 100–200 years. Therefore, many remaining objects are in danger of oxidation and eventual rapid deterioration. The leading causes of the disturbances aredredging,bottom trawlingfishing boats, agricultural activities, peat cutting, groundwater extraction by water wells and establishments of larger infrastructural facilities like expressways, water treatment plants, and in some instances, large-scale nature re-establishment projects.\n\nTheTorahmakes provision for \"free-will offerings\" which may be made by any individual. These are different from votive offerings which are linked to a vow. cf Leviticus 22.23 where the Hebrew root letters for a freewill offering are נדב (nadab), but for a votive offering are נדר (nadar). In this verse a clear differentiation is made between the two. See Strongs numbers H5068 where the Hitpael is to volunteer, or make a free will offering and H5087 where the Qal is to vow a vow.\n\nWhenSolomonbuilt the first temple he provided a number of furnishings above and beyond what had been commanded toMosesonMount Sinai(seeTemple of Solomon).\n\nOral traditioninRabbinic Judaismalso speaks of a huge golden grape vineartifactoutside of the holy site of theTemple in Jerusalembefore its destruction by the Romans.\n\nChristianity\n\n\n## Christianity\n\n\nThe tradition of votive offerings has been carried into Christianity in both the East and the West. The particular type of thevotive crown, originally Byzantine, was also adopted in the West.\n\nEastern Christianity\n\n\n### Eastern Christianity\n\n\nAccording toSacred Tradition, afterConstantine the Great's conversion and subsequent victory at theBattle of the Milvian Bridge, he donated one of the crosses he carried in battle to the Church. This cross is reputed to be preserved onMount Athos.\n\nOne of the most famousOrthodoxvotive offerings is that bySaintJohn of Damascus. According totradition, while he was serving asViziertoCaliphAl-Walid I, he was falsely accused of treachery and his hand was cut off. Upon praying in front of aniconof theTheotokoshis hand wasmiraculouslyrestored. In thanksgiving, he had a silver replica of his hand fashioned and attached it to the icon (see image at right). This icon, now called \"Trojeručica\" (The Three-handed) is preserved atHilandarMonastery onMount Athos.\n\nOrthodox Christians continue to make votive offerings to this day, often in the form oftamata, metal plaques symbolizing the subject of theirprayers. Other offerings includecandles,prosphora, wine, oil, orincense. In addition, many will leave something of personal value, such as jewelry, apectoral crossormilitary decorationas a sign of devotion.\n\nWestern Christianity\n\n\n### Western Christianity\n\n\nRoman Catholicism\n\n\n#### Roman Catholicism\n\n\nIn theRoman Catholic Church, offerings were made either to fulfill avowmade to God for deliverance, or a thing left to a Church in gratitude for some favor that was granted. Today, votives can be litvotive candles, offered flowers, statues, vestments and monetary donations. Traditional special forms of votive offeringex votosinclude small silver models of the afflicted part of the body, inscribed stone tablets,folk artpaintings of an incident of dangersuch as thevotive paintings of Mexicoand model ships donated by sailors who have survived a dangerous voyage. In the Spanish-speaking world amilagrois a small metal offering, equivalent to the Orthodoxtamata.\n\nMany Catholic churches still have areas where such offerings are displayed.Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, Paris, displays over 10,000, with a military specialization and including many military decorations given by their recipients. TheVotive Church, Viennais a late example of many churches which are themselves votive offerings, in this case built to give thanks for a narrow escape from assassination by EmperorFranz Joseph I of Austriain 1853.\n\nMedieval examples include:\n\nSeveralvotive crowns, such as those in theTreasure of GuarrazarProbably theIron Crown of LombardyHenry III of Englandhad a golden statue of his queen made and placed on the shrine ofSt. Edwardat WestminsterA falcon in wax at the shrine ofSaint WulstanbyEdward IA diamond and a ruby, adorning the tomb ofSt. Thomas BecketatCanterburyNumerous crutches, left in the grotto atLourdesThe song \"O Wilhelme, pastor bone\" composed byJohn Taverneris a Votive Antiphon dedicated toCardinal Wolsey\n\nEspecially in the Latin world, there is a tradition of votive paintings, typically depicting a dangerous incident which the offeror survived. Thevotive paintings of Mexicoare paralleled in other countries. In Italy, where more than 15,000 ex-voto paintings are thought to survive from before 1600, these began to appear in the 1490s, probably modelled on the smallpredellapanels belowaltarpieces.These are a form offolk art, typically painted on tin plates salvaged from packaging. Other examples may be large and grand paintings, such asTitian'sJacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter, given in thanks for a naval victory.\n\nLutheranism\n\n\n#### Lutheranism\n\n\nThe practice of votive offerings inLutheran Churches, such as theChurch of Sweden, continued after the Reformation.\n\nInBuddhism, votive offerings usually take the form of a small clay orterracottatablet bearing Buddhist images, usuallyBuddharupaand contain text. These tablets are left in sacred Buddhist sites by devotees as an offering during their pilgrimage. An example are Buddhist Tibetan votive tablets made for a pilgrimage toBodhgaya. Votive tablets served both as meritorious offerings and as souvenirs. Most were made of clay, while a more rare and expensive tablet was made from metal.Historically, votive tablets can be found in Asian Buddhist lands, from Japan,India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Malaysia. In Thailand, votive tablets are known asThai Buddha amulets, a kind of Thai Buddhist blessed item used to raise temple funds by producing the amulets.\n\nAyagapatais a type ofvotiveslab associated with worship inJainism. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites likeKankali TilanearMathurain India. Some of them date back to the 1st century. These slabs are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as thestupa,dharmacakraandtriratna.\n\nA large number ofayagapata(tablet of homage) votive tablets for offerings and the worship oftirthankarawere found atMathura.\n\nThese stone tablets bear a resemblance to the earlierShilapatas, stone tablets that were placed under trees to worshipYakshas. However, this was done by indigenous folk communities beforeJainismoriginated, suggesting that both have commonalities in rituals.A scholar on Jain art wrote about anAyagapatadiscovered around Kankali Tila: \"The technical name of such a tablet wasAyagapatameaning homage panel.\"\n\nAnathemaDevotional articlesFavissaFire worshipGrave goodsPinaxRalaghan ManSenjafudaSin offeringVotive candleVotive site\n\nAnathemaDevotional articlesFavissaFire worshipGrave goodsPinaxRalaghan ManSenjafudaSin offeringVotive candleVotive site\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nAlan Dundes.The Walled-up Wife.

  "Women in Etruscan society": "Women were respected inEtruscan societycompared to theirancient GreekandRoman counterparts. Today only the status of aristocratic women is known because no documentation survives about women in other social classes.\n\nWomen's role and image evolved during the millennium of theEtruscanperiod. Affluent women were well-groomed and lived a family life within society, where their role was important both politically and administratively.TanaquilandVelia Spurinna[fr]were among the women who played leading roles in Etruscan politics. In the final phase ofEtruscan history, women lost much of their independence amidst conquest by theRoman Republic, and their status became that of Roman women.\n\nWomen and Etruscan society\n\n\n## Women and Etruscan society\n\n\nEtruscan women were politically important, and dominant in family and social life. Their status inEtruscan civilizationdiffered from their Greek and the Roman peers, who were considered to be marginal and secondary in relation to men.\n\nAncient writers likeLivyandPliny the Elderattest to the influence of women such asTanaquilandVelia Spurinna[fr].Livydescribes the decisive role played by Tanaquil, the wife ofLucius Tarquinius Priscus. She predicted her husband's success and protected Roman royalty after his assassination.At the beginning of the first century,Claudiustook as his first wifePlautia Urgulanilla, anEtruscan.Pliny refers to Tanaquil as a model of womanly virtue.\n\nContemporary images of Etruscan women often show them wearing rich attire.Archaeological pieces found in the tombs, such asfrescoes,sarcophagi, urns, and funerary possessions testify to the importance of women in society.Thespindle whorlandspring scalediscovered in the tombs of Etruscan women show that they also practiced manual work, such asspinningandweaving.They participated in banquets, physical exercises, and attended games in which naked athletes participated; and generally could enjoy public life without being stigmatized by men.On occasion, women presided over events from a privileged platform, as shown on the fresco of Orvieto or the plaque ofMurlo. In addition they could own property under their name, manage their homes, and conduct trade.On the frescoes of theTomba delle Bighe[es], noble men and women mingle in the samebleachers.\n\nOn funerary urns and on the lids of sarcophagi, they appear as they were in daily life, without retouching, their faces often marked by wrinkles and their bodies showing aging, testifying to a strong character.This type of representation is practically unique in the ancient world, where women were limited to their role as wives, mothers orconcubines.[unreliable source?]\n\nEtruscologistJacques Heurgonquotes the anecdote reported by Livy of a woman who despises her sister because \"she lacksmuliebris audacia\", that is to say, the energy and ambition that seem characteristic of Etruscan women.Sybille Haynesstudied small bronze sculptures, the oldest of which shows women and men lying in atriclinium, raising the drinking cup; but in the most recent examples, they are sitting next to the husband lying down. Between the two series, theRomanschanged the status of women in the Etruscan society throughRomanization.\n\nThe evolution of women's status by period\n\n\n## The evolution of women's status by period\n\n\nThe characteristics of Etruscan women depended on their social rank, the place where they lived, and the period concerned. The Etruscan world cannot be considered as a homogeneous whole from the social, political, and economic points of view. It is nevertheless possible to highlight in general terms the main characteristics by examining the information and clues that have emerged during archaeological research, comparing them whenever possible with ancient texts.\n\nVillanovan period\n\n\n### Villanovan period\n\n\nDuring theVillanovan period(9th – 8th century BC), parity between men and women seems to have been the rule. The unity of burials between the unmarried couple is evidenced by burialtrousseauxof the period, shows no class differences or dominant personalities or families. The presence of characteristic status symbols, such as weapons for men andspindle whorls, weights, mirrors, and crockery for women, seems to indicate a clear separation of the fields of competence attributed to the two sexes, the status of warrior-farmer for men and the organization of the home for women.\n\nHowever, even in burials of this early period, exceptions have been identified: some burials have both types of characteristic status symbols or neither. Therefore, the original belief that Villanovan Etruscan women were weavers while Villanovan Etruscan men were warriors may not be entirely true.\n\nOrientalizing period\n\n\n### Orientalizing period\n\n\nDuring the Orientalizing period (approximately 750 to 500 BC, definitions differ), wealth was monopolized by a small number of individuals, revealing social differences, with hereditary transmission that does not seem to mark any distinction between the sexes. Women and men were equally wealthy in their burial trousseaux, as demonstrated by the findings of theRegolini-Galassi tombin Cerveteri and tombs 2 and 11 of thenecropolis of Banditella[fr].\n\nGoldfibula,Regolini-Galassi tomb(675–650 BC)Gold-leafpectoral, Regolini-Galassi tombGold bracelet, Regolini-Galassi tomb\n\nArchaic period\n\n\n### Archaic period\n\n\nThe Archaic period (580 to 480 BC) highlights women's status in marriage, as evidenced by theSarcophagus of the Spouses(530 BC,Museum of Villa Giulia). The frescoes of the tombs of Tarquinia (6th – 5th century BC) confirm the presence of women in social spaces (banquets and sports), which among the Romans and the Greeks were reserved exclusively for men. But their participation and representation in these events do not seem to confirmTheopompus' claim of women's immorality. Indeed, the frescoes that show couples of spouses, highlight strong monogamous couples. The sarcophagi of semi-lying couples of Vulci (fourth century BC) seem to confirm this fact. Nevertheless, women appear in artistic representations onAttic vasesdancing totally naked on an equal footing with men,and tomb frescoes reveal, as in theTomb of the Bulls, daring erotic scenes showing a woman with several partners, or participating in complicated sexual games.\n\nAlready in the 7th century BC,Tanaquil, an aristocrat from the city ofTarquinia, was skilled in the art ofdivination, \"like all Etruscans\". She urged her husband to leaveEtruriaand settle in Rome. On the way, she interpreted a prodigy and assured him that he would rule Rome, which happened after the death ofAncus Marcius. WhenTarquin the Elderwas assassinated, she had her son-in-lawServius Tulliusproclaimed king.Historian Alain Hus deduced from these accounts thatEtrusca disciplina, the art of interpreting divine signs, was the prerogative of aristocratic families among the Etruscans, and that women could exercise it.\n\nSarcophagi of spousesTheSarcophagus of the Spouses(or Cerveteri Sarcophagus) at theLouvreAt the National Etruscan Museum in Rome'sVilla GiuliaAt the National Archaeological Museum ofUmbriainPerugiaUrna degli Sposi,Guarnacci Etruscan Museum[it],Volterra\n\nClassic period\n\n\n### Classic period\n\n\nDuring the Classical period, Etruscan women began to show signs of high rank and esteem. The sarcophagi of Chiusi, the urns of Volterra and the frescoes in tombs confirm the high position reached by women on the social ladder.\n\nInonomastics(of proper names), women's civil status in inscriptions was indicated by their first name, absent in the Latin formulation, and then by their surname, which remained their birth name, even after marriage. In the onomastic formula, thematronymicadded to thepatronymicbecame widespread from the 4th century BC onwards, proving the high regard in which the wives' family of origin was held by the Etruscan aristocratic class.\n\nHellenistic period\n\n\n### Hellenistic period\n\n\nRomanizationbegan around 340 BC and lasted until theAugustanperiod, when acculturation led to the disappearance of Etruscan political power, as their cultural traits were assimilated by the Romans. Etruscan women lost many of their privileges, and adopted the status ofRoman women, who probably also assimilated some of the cultural traits of Etruscan women and gave them a strong influence, such as that exercised byLivia(58 BC – 29 AD), the wife of Augustus, several timesregentand advisor to her husband and the most powerful woman in the early Roman Empire.Several women in the imperial family, includingAgrippina the Younger, also exerted political influence.\n\nWomen and the family\n\n\n## Women and the family\n\n\nDuring banquets women lay on thetricliniumnext to their husbands, who acknowledged their equal social position in the management of the family patrimony and the upbringing of their children.Together with their fathers, women gave their names to their children (especially among the highest class of society), with funeralepigramsgiving priority to thematronymic; women are also referred to by theirgensnames and with their own first names, affirming their individuality within the family group.Women's proper names frequently engraved on crockery and funerary frescoes include: Ati, Culni, Fasti, Larthia, Ramtha, Tanaquille, Veilia, Velia and Velka. By comparison, in Roman society, women are referred to by a feminized form of theirnomen gentilicium: thus, all the women of the Liviagensare called Livia.\n\nWomen's fashion\n\n\n## Women's fashion\n\n\nAccording to the frescoes and tombs of the Etruscans, women wore elaborate jewelry and make-up. They were often dressed in a tunic over which was placed thechiton, a kind of long coat with short sleeves, edged with small geometric motifs such as incised circles and herringbones. Shoes have pointed, raised toes, reminiscent ofHittitemodels. Hair is worn under thetutulus, a round or conical headdress decorated with geometric motifs, or is gathered at the nape of the neck, with curls falling over the shoulders or in braids framing the face.\n\nEtruscan Clothing –Costumes of All Nations(1882)Fresco of the motionless Dancer with large steps carrying thechiton.Tomb of the Lionessesin theMonterozzi necropolis.\n\nWomen's accessories\n\n\n## Women's accessories\n\n\nArchaeological findings in burialtrousseauxin necropolises, as well as fresco depictions, give a fairly accurate idea of the various accessories used by Etruscan women. Feminine adornment consisted of jewelry, braided gold wire pendants adorned with figurines,palmettesand flowers, necklaces, and precious metal earrings and pins. Etruscan women also had a wide range of refined toiletries at their disposal:ivory,alabasterand glass flasks, containers for ointments or perfumed oils,manicureinstruments, engraved mirrors decorated with mythological scenes, featuring a slightly domed reflective surface and a reverse side decorated with incised motifs, bronze storage boxes decorated with engraved scenes, and so on.\n\nGold necklaceGold necklace and fibulae (Regolini-Galassi tomb)Crown and gold jewelryGold earringsMirror\n\nEtruscan women viewed by other civilizations\n\n\n## Etruscan women viewed by other civilizations\n\n\nEtruscan women attended banquets alongside men, unlike their Greek contemporaries where democracy was a male-only affair. Greek, and later Roman writers therefore gave Etruscan women a scandalous reputation, although this discredit – theEtruscan truphè– more generally concerned the morals of both sexes.\n\nBy the Greeks\n\n\n### By the Greeks\n\n\nThe Etruscan tradition of mixed banqueting was frowned upon by the Greeks, where women lived in the shadows of the home. Greek daughters and wives stayed in their place in the domestic setting, rarely appearing in the community. As direct neighbors of the Etruscans inMagna Graecia(southern Italy), they were familiar with this difference in custom.Theopompus, a Greek historian of the 4th century BC, whom another Roman author,Cornelius Nepos, finds very slanderous,gives a contemptuous description:\"Women enjoy all men in complete freedom. In the streets they walk boldly alongside men and dine lying next to them. They have taken great care of their bodies and faces, removing hair from their skin with melted wax and excelling in nudity\". \"There is no shame,\" according to Theopompus, \"in committing a sexual act in public [...] when they gather with friends, this is what they do: first, when they have finished drinking and are ready for bed and while the torches are still lit, the servants sometimes bringcourtesans, sometimes handsome boys and sometimes their own wives [...] Etruscan women make children not knowing who the father is\".\n\nBy the Romans\n\n\n### By the Romans\n\n\nRoman women were slightly freer than Greek women, but the status of Etruscan women was considered scandalous by the Romans, who often described their behavior aslicentiousand immoral, comparing them to the musicians and prostitutes of Greek or Roman banquets. Titus Livius contrasted the \"virtuous Roman mother\" to \"Etruscan women lying on their banquet beds\".\n\nEtruscan civilizationMonterozzi necropolisWomen in ancient RomeEtruscan religionDaily life of the Etruscans\n\nReferences\n\n\n## References\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n\nBonfante, Larissa(1976).Etruscan Dress.
