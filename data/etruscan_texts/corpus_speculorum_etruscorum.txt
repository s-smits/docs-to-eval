The first major systematic study of Etruscan mirror was
Eduard Gerhard
's
Etruskische Spiegel
. The work consists of five volumes published between 1843 and 1897 (the final volume being published after Gerhard's death). In 1973 a decision was made to make a new publication that could replace Gerhard's outdated work.
