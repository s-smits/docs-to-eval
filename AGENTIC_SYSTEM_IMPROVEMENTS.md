# Agentic System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive improvements to the agentic benchmark generation system, including enhanced logic, better prompts, and intelligent automatic determination of benchmark types.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Question Generation (improved_agents.py)

#### Improved Prompts
- **Domain-Specific System Prompts**: Each evaluation type now has a tailored system prompt that provides clear guidelines for question generation
- **Quality Standards**: Explicit quality criteria embedded in prompts
- **Grounding Requirements**: Strong emphasis on using only information from the provided snippet

#### Better Question Logic
```python
IMPROVED_SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
    EvaluationType.DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE: """
        - Test DEEP understanding, not memorization
        - STRICTLY grounded in snippet
        - Use precise domain terminology
        - Require synthesis, not just recall
        - 2-4 sentence explanatory answers
    """,
    
    EvaluationType.FACTUAL_QA: """
        - Test specific, verifiable facts
        - Unambiguous, deterministic answers
        - Focus on key entities, relationships
        - 1-3 sentence factual answers
    """,
    
    # ... and more for each type
}
```

#### Enhanced Answer Type Determination
- **Context-Aware**: Considers both evaluation type and answer content
- **Multi-Signal Analysis**: Uses regex patterns, word count, and content structure
- **Improved Accuracy**: Better classification of numeric, code, boolean, and free-text answers

```python
def _determine_answer_type_improved(answer, question, eval_type):
    # 1. Check eval type for strong signals
    # 2. Analyze answer content patterns
    # 3. Consider question context
    # 4. Return most appropriate type
```

#### Intelligent Difficulty Estimation
- Analyzes question complexity (length, cognitive verbs)
- Considers answer complexity and reasoning depth
- Incorporates evaluation type base difficulty
- Maps to 4-level difficulty scale (basic → expert)

### 2. Intelligent Classification System (intelligent_classifier.py)

#### Multi-Signal Content Analysis
New `ContentSignals` dataclass captures:
- **Density Metrics**: Math, code, technical, factual, narrative densities
- **Complexity Metrics**: Vocabulary diversity, sentence length, domain specificity
- **Structural Metrics**: Code blocks, formulas, lists, diagrams
- **Composite Scores**: Overall complexity (0-10) and abstractness (0-1)

#### Advanced Signal Extraction

##### Mathematical Signals
```python
def _extract_math_signals(text):
    # Detects:
    # - Math terminology (theorem, derivative, integral)
    # - Math operations and symbols
    # - Function calls (sin, cos, log)
    # - Equations and expressions
```

##### Code Signals
```python
def _extract_code_signals(text):
    # Detects:
    # - Function/class definitions
    # - Import statements
    # - Control flow keywords
    # - Code blocks and inline code
    # - Programming operators
```

##### Technical Signals
```python
def _extract_technical_signals(text):
    # Detects:
    # - Acronyms (API, HTTP, JSON)
    # - CamelCase terms
    # - Technical terminology
    # - System/process vocabulary
```

#### Intelligent Scoring System
Each evaluation type scored based on relevant signals:

```python
scores[MATHEMATICAL] = (
    math_density * 0.5 +
    has_formulas * 0.3 +
    complexity_score * 0.2
)

scores[DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE] = (
    domain_specificity * 0.4 +
    technical_density * 0.3 +
    complexity_score * 0.3
)
```

#### Comprehensive Recommendations
`BenchmarkRecommendation` provides:
- Primary and secondary evaluation types
- Confidence score with gap analysis
- Detailed reasoning for classification
- Suggested difficulty level
- Optimal question count
- Whether to use agentic generation
- Minimum validation score threshold
- Expected answer type distribution

### 3. Automatic Configuration

#### Difficulty Suggestion
```python
complexity_score < 3:  "basic"
complexity_score < 6:  "intermediate"
complexity_score < 8:  "hard"
complexity_score >= 8: "expert"
```

#### Question Count Optimization
- Base counts per evaluation type
- Adjusted for content complexity
- More questions for simple content
- Fewer questions for complex content

#### Agentic Decision Logic
Use agentic generation when:
- Complexity score > 5
- Domain specificity > 0.3
- Evaluation type is DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE, CODE_GENERATION, or MATHEMATICAL

#### Validation Thresholds
Type-specific minimum scores:
- Mathematical: 0.8 (highest precision)
- Code Generation: 0.7
- Factual QA: 0.75
- Domain Knowledge: 0.6
- Reading Comprehension: 0.55

### 4. Integration Points

#### Using Enhanced Agents
```python
from docs_to_eval.core.agentic.improved_agents import EnhancedQuestionWriter

# Replace standard QuestionWriter
question_writer = EnhancedQuestionWriter(llm_interface=llm, config=agent_config)

# Generate with improved prompts and logic
draft = await question_writer.produce(
    concept="neural networks",
    corpus_text=corpus,
    eval_type=EvaluationType.DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE
)
```

#### Using Intelligent Classifier
```python
from docs_to_eval.core.agentic.intelligent_classifier import IntelligentBenchmarkClassifier

classifier = IntelligentBenchmarkClassifier()

# Get comprehensive analysis
signals = classifier.analyze_corpus(corpus_text)
print(f"Math density: {signals.math_density:.2%}")
print(f"Complexity: {signals.complexity_score:.1f}/10")

# Get full recommendation
recommendation = classifier.recommend_benchmark_type(corpus_text)
print(f"Primary: {recommendation.primary_type}")
print(f"Confidence: {recommendation.confidence:.2%}")
print(f"Reasoning: {recommendation.reasoning}")
print(f"Use agentic: {recommendation.use_agentic}")
print(f"Suggested questions: {recommendation.suggested_question_count}")
```
