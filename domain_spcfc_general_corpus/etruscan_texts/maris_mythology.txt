# Maris (mythology)

Maris(orMariś) was anEtruscangod often depicted as an infant or child and given manyepithets, includingMariś Halna,Mariś Husrnana("Maris the Child"), andMariś Isminthians. He was the son ofHercle, the Etruscan equivalent ofHeracles. On twobronze mirrors, Maris appears in scenes depicting an immersion rite presumably to ensure his immortality.Massimo Pallottinonoted that Maris might have been connected to stories about thecentaurMares, the legendary ancestor of theAusones, who underwent a triple death and resurrection.

Some scholars think he influenced Roman conceptions of the godMars,but this is not universally held; more likely he was the god of fertility and love, similar to the Greek Eros.

In theLead Plaque of Magliano, he is calledMaris Menita"Maris the Maker", the full dedicatory line translated:

For Maris Menita (="the Maker"), for the ancestors, also this previously mentioned annually appointed village-priest must make a dedication in theciala,and in addition in the place of offering, and in theichuhouse
