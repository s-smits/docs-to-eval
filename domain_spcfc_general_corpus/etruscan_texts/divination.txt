Divination(fromLatindivinare'to foresee, foretell, predict, prophesy')is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of anocculticritual or practice.Using various methods throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how aquerentshould proceed by reading signs, events, oromens, or through alleged contact or interaction withsupernaturalagenciessuch asspirits, gods, god-like-beings or the "will of theuniverse".

In its functional relation tomagicin general, divination can have a preliminary and investigative role:

the diagnosis or prognosis achieved through divination is both temporarily and logically related to the manipulative, protective or alleviative function of magic rituals. In divination one finds the cause of an ailment or a potential danger, in magic one subsequently acts upon this knowledge.

Divination has long attracted criticism. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by thescientific communityand by skeptics as beingsuperstitious; experiments do not support the idea  that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.In antiquity, divination came under attack from philosophers such as theAcademic skepticCiceroinDe Divinatione(1st century BCE) and thePyrrhonistSextus EmpiricusinAgainst the Astrologers(2nd century CE). The satiristLucian(c.125 – after 180) devoted an essay toAlexander the false prophet.

Theeternal fire at Nymphaionin southernIllyria(present-dayAlbania) also functioned as an oracle. The forms of divination practiced in this natural fire sanctuary with peculiar physical properties were widely known to the ancient Greek and Roman authors.The Oracle ofAmunat theSiwa Oasiswas made famous whenAlexander the Greatvisited it after conquering Egypt from Persia in 332 BC.

Deuteronomy 18:10–12orLeviticus 19:26can be interpreted as categorically forbidding divination. But some biblical practices, such asUrim and Thummim,casting lotsandprayer, are considered to be divination. Trevan G. Hatch disputes these comparisons because divination did not consult the "one true God" and manipulated the divine for the diviner's self-interest.One of the earliest known divination artifacts, a book called the Sortes Sanctorum, is believed to be of Christian roots, and utilizes dice to provide insight into the future.

Uri Gabbay states that divination was associated with sacrificial rituals in the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia and Israel. Extispicy was a common example, where diviners would pray to their god(s) beforevivisectinga sacrificial animal. Their abdominal organs would reveal a divine message, which aligned withcardiocentricviews of the mind.

Oracles and Greek divination


#### Oracles and Greek divination


Both oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination.Oracleswere the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles’ limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (Greek:μάντεις).

Seers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods includingextispicy,ornithomancy, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel toDelphior other such distant sites.

Because the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks,and theStoicsaccounted for the validity of divination in theirphysics.

The divination method of casting lots (Cleromancy) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus inActs 1:23–26to select a replacement forJudas Iscariot. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christianemperorsduringancient Rome.

In 692 theQuinisext Council, also known as the "Council in Trullo" in theEastern Orthodox Church, passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices.Fortune-tellingand other forms of divination were widespread through theMiddle Ages.In the constitution of 1572 and public regulations of 1661 of theElectorate of Saxony, capital punishment was used on those predicting the future.Laws forbidding divination practice continue to this day.TheWaldensianssect were accused of practicing divination.

Smålandis famous forÅrsgång, a practice which occurred until the early 19th century in some parts of Småland. Generally occurring on Christmas and New Year's Eve, it is a practice in which one would fast and keep themselves away from light in a room until midnight to then complete a set of complex events to interpret symbols encountered throughout the journey to foresee the coming year.

InIslam,astrology(‘ilm ahkam al-nujum), the most widespread divinatory science, is the study of how celestial entities could be applied to the daily lives of people on earth.It is important to emphasize the practical nature of divinatory sciences because people from all socioeconomic levels and pedigrees sought the advice of astrologers to make important decisions in their lives.Astronomywas made a distinct science by intellectuals who did not agree with the former, although distinction may not have been made in daily practice, where astrology was technically outlawed and only tolerated if it was employed in public. Astrologers, trained as scientists and astronomers, were able to interpret the celestial forces that ruled the "sub-lunar" to predict a variety of information fromlunar phasesand drought to times of prayer and the foundation of cities. The courtly sanction and elite patronage ofMuslimrulers benefited astrologers’ intellectual statures.

The “science of the sand” (‘ilm al-raml), otherwise translated asgeomancy, is “based on the interpretation of figures traced on sand or other surface known asgeomantic figures.”It is a good example of Islamic divination at a popular level. The core principle that meaning derives from a unique occupied position is identical to the core principle of astrology.

Like astronomy, geomancy used deduction and computation to uncover significantpropheciesas opposed toomens(‘ilm al-fa’l), which were process of “reading” visible random events to decipher the invisible realities from which they originated. It was upheld byprophetictradition and relied almost exclusively on text, specifically theQur’an(which carried a table for guidance) and poetry, as a development ofbibliomancy.One example for this is this Qur'an from Gwalior, India, which includes a set of instructions to use the Qur’an as a divinatory text. It is the earliest known example of its kind.The practice culminated in the appearance of the illustrated “Books of Omens” (Falnama) in the early 16th century, an embodiment of the apocalyptic fears as the end of the millennium in theIslamic calendarapproached.

Dream interpretation, oroneiromancy(‘ilm ta’bir al-ru’ya), is more specific to Islam than other divinatory science, largely because of the Qur’an’s emphasis on the predictive dreams ofAbraham,Yusuf, andMuhammad. The important delineation within the practice lies between “incoherent dreams” and “sound dreams,” which were “a part of prophecy” or heavenly message.Dream interpretationwas always tied to Islamic religious texts, providing a moral compass to those seeking advice. The practitioner needed to be skilled enough to apply the individual dream to general precedent while appraising the singular circumstances.

The power of text held significant weight in the "science of letters"(‘ilm al-huruf), the foundational principle being "God created the world through His speech."The science began with the concept of language, specificallyArabic, as the expression of "the essence of what it signifies."Once the believer understood this, while remaining obedient to God’s will, they could uncover the essence and divine truth of the objects inscribed with Arabic likeamuletsandtalismansthrough the study of the letters of the Qur’an with alphanumeric computations.

In Islamic practice inSenegalandGambia, just like many otherWest Africancountries, diviners and religious leaders andhealerswere interchangeable because Islam was closely related with esoteric practices (like divination), which were responsible for the regional spread of Islam. As scholars learned esoteric sciences, they joined local non-Islamic aristocratic courts, who quickly aligned divination and amulets with the "proof of the power of Islamic religion."So strong was the idea of esoteric knowledge in West African Islam, diviners andmagiciansuneducated in Islamic texts and Arabic bore the same titles as those who did.

From the beginning of Islam, there "was (and is) still a vigorous debate about whether or not such [divinatory] practices were actually permissible under Islam,” with some scholars likeAbu-Hamid al Ghazili(d. 1111) objecting to the science of divination because he believed it bore too much similarity topaganpractices of invoking spiritual entities that were not God.Other scholars justified esoteric sciences by comparing a practitioner to "a physician trying to heal the sick with the help of the same natural principles."

Mesoamerica


### Mesoamerica


Divination was a central component of ancientMesoamericanreligious life. ManyAztec gods, including centralcreator gods, were described as diviners and were closely associated withsorcery.Tezcatlipocais the patron of sorcerers and practitioners ofmagic. His name means "smoking mirror," a reference to a device used for divinatoryscrying.In theMayanPopol Vuh, the creator godsXmucane and Xpiacocperform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.The AztecCodex Borbonicusshows the original human couple,OxomocoandCipactonal, engaged in divining with kernels of maize. This primordial pair is associated with the ritual calendar, and the Aztecs considered them to be the first diviners.

Every civilization that developed inpre-Columbian Mexico, from theOlmecsto theAztecs, practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces,mirrors, or thecasting of lotswere among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice.Visionsderived fromhallucinogenswere another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more commonhallucinogenic plantsused in divination aremorning glory,jimson weed, andpeyote.

India and Nepal


### India and Nepal


Theyyamor "theiyam" inMalayalamis the process by which a devotee invites aHindugod or goddess to use his or her body as a medium or channel and answer other devotees' questions.The same is called "arulvaakku" or "arulvaak" inTamil, another south Indian language -Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetamis famous for arulvakku inTamil Nadu.The people in and aroundMangaloreinKarnatakacall the same,Buta Kola, "paathri" or "darshin"; in other parts of Karnataka, it is known by various names such as, "prashnaavali", "vaagdaana", "asei", "aashirvachana", and so on.InNepalit is known as, "Devta ka dhaamee" or "jhaakri".

In English, the closest translation for these is, "oracle." TheDalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as theNechung Oracle, which is considered the official state oracle of the government ofTibet. The Dalai Lama has according to centuries-old custom, consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities ofLosar.

Although Japan retains a history of traditional and localmethods of divination, such asonmyōdō, contemporary divination in Japan, calleduranai, derives from outside sources.Contemporary methods of divination in Japan include both Western and Chineseastrology,geomancyorfeng shui,tarot cards,I Ching(Book of Changes)divination, andphysiognomy(methods of reading the body to identify traits).

Personality types


#### Personality types


Personality typing as a form of divination has been prevalent in Japan since the 1980s. Various methods exist for divining personality type. Each attempt to reveal glimpses of an individual's destiny, productive and inhibiting traits, future parenting techniques, and compatibility in marriage. Personality type is increasingly important for young Japanese, who consider personality the driving factor of compatibility, given the ongoing marriage drought andbirth rate declinein Japan.

An import to Japan,Chinese zodiacsigns based on the birth year in 12 year cycles (rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, cock, dog, and boar) are frequently combined with other forms of divination, such as so-called 'celestial types' based on the planets (Saturn, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, or Uranus). Personality can also be divined using cardinal directions, thefour elements(water, earth, fire, air), andyin-yang. Names can also lend important personality information under name classification which asserts that names bearing certain Japanese vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o) share common characteristics.Numerology, which utilizes methods of divining 'birth numbers' from significant numbers such as birth date, may also reveal character traits of individuals.

Individuals can also assess their own and others' personalities according to physical characteristics.Blood typeremains a popular form of divination from physiology. Stemming from Western influences, body reading orninsou, determines personality traits based on body measurements. The face is the most commonly analyzed feature, with eye size, pupil shape, mouth shape, and eyebrow shape representing the most important traits. An upturned mouth may be cheerful, and a triangle eyebrow may indicate that someone is strong-willed.

Methods of assessment in daily life may include self-taken measurements or quizzes. As such, magazines targeted at women in their early-to-mid twenties feature the highest concentration of personality assessment guides. There are approximately 144 different women's magazines, known asnihon zashi koukoku kyoukai, published in Japan aimed at this audience.

Japanese tarot


#### Japanese tarot


The adaptation of the Western divination method of tarot cards into Japanese culture presents a particularly unique example of contemporary divination as this adaptation mingles with Japan's robust visual culture. Japanese tarot cards are created by professional artists, advertisers, and fans of tarot. One tarot card collector claimed to have accumulated more than 1,500 Japan-made decks of tarot cards.

Japanese tarot cards fall into diverse categories such as:

Inspiration Tarot (reikan tarotto);I-Ching Tarot (ekisen tarotto);Spiritual Tarot (supirichuaru tarotto);Western Tarot (seiyō tarotto); andEastern Tarot (tōyō tarotto).

The images on tarot cards may come from images from Japanese popular culture, such as characters frommangaandanimeincludingHello Kitty, or may feature cultural symbols. Tarot cards may adapt the images of Japanese historical figures, such as high priestessHimiko(170–248CE) or imperial court wizardAbe no Seimei(921–1005CE). Still others may feature images of cultural displacement, such as English knights,pentagrams, the JewishTorah, or inventedglyphs. The introduction of such cards began by the 1930s and reached prominence 1970s. Japanese tarot cards were originally created by men, often based on theRider-Waite-Smith tarotpublished by the Rider Company in London in 1909.Since, the practice of Japanese tarot has become overwhelmingly feminine and intertwined withkawaiiculture. Referring to the cuteness of tarot cards, Japanese model Kuromiya Niina was quoted as saying "because the images are cute, even holding them is enjoyable."While these differences exist, Japanese tarot cards function similarly to their Western counterparts. Cards are shuffled and cut into piles then used to forecast the future, for spiritual reflection, or as a tool for self-understanding.

A more serious type of divination is the Kiō-á. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, while the incense is being burned, and thedeityis invited to descend onto the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually, the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the deity who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted for the devotees.

Contemporary divination in Africa


## Contemporary divination in Africa


Divinationis widespread throughout Africa. Among many examples it is one of the central tenets ofSerer religionin Senegal. Only those who have been initiated asSaltigues(theSererhigh priests and priestesses) can divine the future.These are the "hereditary rain priests"whose role is both religious and medicinal.

Divination of demons


## Divination of demons


In his work entitledOn the divination of demons,saintAugustine of Hippoaffirms that, most of the time,demonssimply predict what they do in the future. However, they also possess a divinatory power essentially deriving from the greater acuity of the senses of their aerial bodies and the experience accumulated during their long lives. This allows them to interpret divine signs of the times in the natural world that humans are unable to grasp and to foretell future events, even those that are not immediate. Furthermore, they can cause illnesses and fantastic visions in people in both a sleeping and waking state.The accuracy of the predictions clashes with their evil and deceptive nature, and with God's higher plans that are only known and holy angels can divert and override the signs caught by demons in the natural world.
