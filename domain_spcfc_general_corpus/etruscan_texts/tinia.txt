# Tinia

Tinia(alsoTin,Tinh,TinsorTina) was thesky godand the highest deity inEtruscan religion, equivalent to theRomanJupiterand theGreekZeus.

However, a primary source from the Roman Varro states thatVeltha, not Tins, was the supreme deity of the Etruscans.This has led some scholars to conclude that they were assimilated, but this is speculation.

Tinia was the husband ofUniand the father ofHercle. Like many other Etruscan deities, his name isgender neutral.

TheEtruscanshad a group of nine gods who had the power of hurling thunderbolts; they were calledNovensilesby theRomans.Of thunderbolts there were eleven sorts, of which Tinia wielded three.

Tinia was sometimes represented with a beard or sometimes as youthful and beardless.In terms ofsymbolism, Tinia has thethunderbolt.Tinia's thunderbolts could be red or blood coloured.

LikeSelvansand possiblyLaran,Tinia also protected boundaries. His name appears as the guarantor on three boundary stones with identical inscriptions found inTunisia, originally placed there by the Etruscan colonists.

Some of Tinia's possibleepithetsare detailed on thePiacenza Liver, a bronze model of a liver used forharuspicy. These inscriptions have been transcribed asTin Cilens,Tin ΘufandTinś Θne. There have been a number of suggestions as to their meaning, but theEtruscan languageis poorly understood and there is no scholarly consensus for the translation.
