# Villanovan culture

TheVillanovan culture(c.900–700 BCE), regarded as the earliest phase of theEtruscan civilization,was the earliestIron Ageculture ofItaly. It directly followed theBronze AgeProto-Villanovan culturewhich branched off from theUrnfield cultureofCentral Europe.The name derives from the locality of Villanova, a fraction of the municipality ofCastenasoin theMetropolitan City of Bolognawhere, between 1853 and 1855,Giovanni Gozzadinifound the remains of a necropolis, bringing to light 193 tombs, of which there were 179 cremations and 14 inhumations.

The Villanovans introduced iron-working to theItalian Peninsula. They practicedcremationand buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of distinctive double-cone shape.

The nameVillanovanof the early phases of the Etruscan civilization comes from the site of the first archaeological finds relating to this advanced culture, which were remnants of a cemetery found nearVillanova(Castenaso, 12 kilometres east ofBologna) innorthern Italy. The excavation lasting from 1853 to 1855 was done by the scholar and site owner, countGiovanni Gozzadini, and involved 193 tombs, six of which were separated from the rest as if to signify a special social status. The "well tomb" pit graves lined with stones containedfunerary urns. These had been only sporadically plundered and most were untouched. In 1893, a chance discovery unearthed another distinctive Villanovan necropolis atVerucchiooverlooking theAdriaticcoastal plain.

The burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central EuropeanUrnfield culture(c.1300–750 BCE) and CelticHallstatt culturethat succeeded the Urnfield culture. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Cremated remains were placed incinerary urns, specifically in biconical urnsand then buried. The urns were a form of Villanovan pottery known asimpasto.A custom believed to originate with the Villanovan culture is the usage of hut-shaped urns, which were cinerary urns fashioned like the huts in which the villagers lived. Typicalsgraffitodecorations ofswastikas,meanders, andsquareswere scratched with a comb-like tool. Urns were accompanied by simple bronzefibulae, razors and rings.

Periodization


## Periodization


The Villanovan culture is broadly divided intoVillanovan Ifromc.960 BCEtoc.801 BCEand theVillanovan IIfromc.800 BCEto 720 BCE. The later phase (Villanovan II) saw radical changes, evidence of contact with Hellenic civilization and trade with the north along theAmber Road. This evidence takes the form of glass andambernecklaces for women, armor and horse harness fittings ofbronze, and the development of elite graves in contrast to the earlier egalitarian culture.Chamber tombs and inhumation (burial) practices were developed side-by-side with the earliercremationpractices. With the last phase of Villanovan II the Etruscans, in particularSouthern Etruria, entered theOrientalizing period. The northernmost areas of the Etruscan world, such as Etruria Padana, continued in their development asVillanovan III(750–680 BCE)  andVillanovan IV(680–540 BCE).

Metalwork and trade


## Metalwork and trade


The metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery demonstrate the skill of the Villanovan artisans. Some grave goods from burial sites display an even higher quality, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture. Tools and items were placed in graves suggesting a belief in an afterlife. Men's graves contained weapons, armor, while those for women included weaving tools. A few graves switched or mixed these, indicating the possibility that some women employed tools and that some men made clothing.

During the Villanovan period Etruscans traded with other states from the Mediterranean such as Greeks, Balkans, and Sardinia. Trade brought about advancement in metallurgy, and Greek presence influenced Villanovan pottery.

Buildings were rectangular in shape. The people lived in small huts, made of wattle and daub with wooden poles for support. Within the huts, cooking stands, utensils and charred animal bones give evidence about the family life of early inhabitants in Italy.Some huts contained large pottery jars for food storage sunk into their floors. There was also a rock cut drain to channel rainwater to communal reservoirs.

Villanovan settlements


## Villanovan settlements


Generally speaking, Villanovan settlements were centered in the AdriaticEtruria, inEmilia Romagna(in particular, inBolognaand inVerucchio, nearRimini), inMarche(Fermo), and in the Tyrrhenian Etruria, inTuscanyandLazio. Further south, Villanovan cremation burials are to be found inCampania, atCapua, at the "princely tombs" ofPontecagnanonearSalerno,at Capo di Fiume, atVallo di Dianoand atSala Consilina.

Small scattered Villanovan settlements have left few traces other than their more permanent burial sites, which were set somewhat apart from the settlements—largely because the settlement sites were built over in Etruscan times. Modern opinion generally followsMassimo Pallottinoin regarding the Villanovan culture as ancestral to theEtruscan civilization.

A genetic study published inSciencein November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Villanovan culture buried inVeio Grotta Gramiccia, Italy between ca. 900 BCE and 800 BCE. She carried the maternal haplogroupK1a4,found all over Europe since Neolithic times,and her autosomal DNA was a mixture of 72.9%Copper Ageancestry (EEF+WHG) and 27.1%Steppe-related ancestry.There was evidence for consanguinity for this sample with another ancient sample (700 BCE - 600 BCE) from the Etruscan necropolis of La Mattonara nearCivitavecchia, compatible with being the latter an offspring of third-degree relatives from the former.
