Previous scholarship thought thatMarís, a mysterious figure(s) was theEtruscangod of war due to the similarity of the name to theRomanwar godMars.However, that has been disproven and Laran has been identified as the Etruscan god of war.

Laran may be recognized in Etruscan art from his attributes, or is sometimes identified by his name. SinceEtruscan literaturehas not survived, the meaning of the scenes in which he appears can only be interpreted by comparison to Greek and Roman myths, through information about Etruscan myths preserved by Greek and Latin literature, or through conjectural reconstructions based on other Etruscan representations.

Laran appears with Turms and a youthful, long hairedTiniaon a mirror fromOrvieto,Settecamini. He is shown with a spear and with his hand over a shield, with a sun like motif on it.A scene on an Etruscan mirror showsLeinth,Turan,Menrva, Laran, and twoMariśbabies.
