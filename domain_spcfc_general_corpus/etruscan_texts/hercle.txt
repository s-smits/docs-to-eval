# Hercle

InEtruscan religion,Hercle(alsoHeracleorHercl), the son ofTiniaandUni, was a version of the GreekHeracles, depicted as a muscular figure often carrying a club and wearing a lionskin. He is a popular subject inEtruscan art, particularlybronze mirrors, which show him engaged in adventures not known from theGreek mythsofHeraclesor theRomanand laterclassical mythsofHercules.

In the Etruscan tradition,Uni(RomanJuno) grants Hercle access to a life among the immortals by offering her breast milk to him.Hercle was the first man elevated to a godhood through his deeds and Etruscan aristocrats tried to identify with this ascension, as reflected in artwork and literature.

Hercle differed in many aspects from the GreekHeracles.He seems to have enjoyed a special status in Italy in general.In art, he is shown to be a defender of an unknown goddess against creatures on the other side of a human border, showing his status as aLiminal deity.In Etruria, he was also associated with running water.He was also the master of animals, the protector of flocks and herds, and of herdsmen.

Hercle was more of anoraculargod in Etruria than in Greece.Several inscriptions have come to light from 1970 that show evidence of cult worship.Particularly, a sanctuary at Caere preserved many inscriptions of dedications to the god.In Toledo, a bronze weight and an attic red-figured cup created by Euphronios testify an important cult to Hercle.

## Scenes from Etruscan art


Hercle can be recognized in Etruscan art from his attributes, or is sometimes identified by name. SinceEtruscan literaturehas not survived, the meaning of the scenes in which he appears can only be interpreted by comparison to Greek and Roman myths, through information about Etruscan myths preserved by Greek and Latin literature, or through conjectural reconstructions based on other Etruscan representations.
