Etruscan architecture
was created between about 900 BC and 27 BC, when the expanding civilization of
ancient Rome
finally absorbed
Etruscan civilization
. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood and other materials of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources we have a good deal of information on what once existed.
From about 630 BC, Etruscan architecture was heavily influenced by
Greek architecture
, which was itself developing through the same period.
