# List of Etruscan mythological figures

This is a list of deities and legendary figures found in
Etruscan mythology
.
The names below were taken mainly from Etruscan "picture bilinguals", which are Etruscan
call-outs
on art depicting mythological scenes or motifs. Several different media provide names. Variants of the names are given, reflecting differences in language in different localities and times.
Many of the names are Etruscan spellings (and pronunciations) of Greek names. The themes may or may not be entirely Greek. Etruscans frequently added their own themes to Greek myths. The same may be said of native Italic names rendered into Etruscan. Some names are entirely Etruscan, which is often a topic of debate in the international forum of scholarship.
