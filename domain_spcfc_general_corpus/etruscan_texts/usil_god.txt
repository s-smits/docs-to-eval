# Usil (god)

Usilis theEtruscangodof thesun, shown to be identified withApulu(Apollo). His iconic depiction features Usil rising out of the sea, with a fireball in either outstretched hand, on an engraved Etruscanbronze mirrorin late Archaic style, formerly on the Roman antiquities market.On Etruscan mirrors in the Classical style, Usil appears with anaureole.

He was identified withApulu; appearing on an Etruscan mirror from the Vatican dating from the 4th century BC, on which Usil is seen holding the bow ofApulu.

Usil was identified with theRomanSolandGreekHelios. However, while Usil is depicted as male in some artwork, there are also feminine depictions.There is also a connection with the indigenous Etruscan goddessCatha, who has been interpreted as having a solar character, however she has also been identified with a Lunar character.In artwork, Usil is shown in close association with  thedawn goddessThesan, something almost never seen withHeliosandEos.

Cathahas been identified as "Solis Filia" meaning "Sun's Daughter", making Usil her father.

## In the Liver of Piacenza


Since his name appears on the bronzeliver of Piacenza, next toTiur, meaning both "moon" and "month",since then Tiur has been identified as the name of the personification of the moon, but it was most likely a date. The inscriptions on thePyrgi Tabletsconfirm that "tiur" was meant as "month" for datations,.
