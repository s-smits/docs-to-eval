# Charun

InEtruscan mythology,Charun(also spelledCharu, orKarun) acted as one of thepsychopompoiof theunderworld(not to be confused with the god of the underworld, known to the Etruscans asAita). He is often portrayed withVanth, a winged figure also associated with the underworld.

His name was imported fromGreekCharon,although it is uncertain whether Etruscans had a native name for a god of the underworld before this. As suggested by alternations in theEtruscan languagesuch asθu"one" changing toθunśna"first",lev"lion" (fromGreekleōn)  andApulu(fromGreekApóllōn), words ending in-nafteruwere disappearing from the language which is why we see his name spelledXarunand laterXaru.

Appearance


## Appearance


The Etruscan Charun was fundamentally different from his Greek counterpart. Guarding the entry to the underworld, he is depicted with ahammer(his religious symbol) and is shown with pointed ears, snakes around his arms, and a blueish coloration symbolizing the decay of death. In some images, he has enormous wings. He is also depicted as a large creature withsnake-like hair,avulture's hookednose, largetuskslike aboar,heavy brow ridges,largelips, fiery eyes,pointedearsa blackbeard, enormouswings,discolored (pale cream, bluish or greyish)skin, and snakes around his arm.

Larissa Bonfanteand Judith Swaddling have this to say about Charun:  "Many scenes feature the two purely Etruscan underworld demons, Vanth and Charu, whose job is not to punish the dead but rather to escort them to their final destination."However, there are at least two examples, on the sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas as well as a red figure stamnos from Orbetello, that do illustrate Charun in a menacing fashion.Each depicts Charun threatening a male figure with his hammer.

The grotesque nature of the depiction of Charun appears to have been at least partlyapotropaicin nature. Apotropaic art was the practice of the neighboring Greeks at this time, as represented by the exaggerated eyes painted on drinking vessels in the 6th century BC to ward away spirits while drinking or the monstrous depiction ofMedusawhose image was said to turn men to stone. Through these images of the grotesque, violence, and blood-letting, the Etruscans may have believed that they helped to fend off evil spirits from the tomb as well as sanctify the tomb perhaps in place of the actual ritual sacrifice of an animal usually performed in funerary rites.

Nancy de Grummond offers a different view. The relief on the sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas atTarquinia, shows two Charuns swinging their hammers at a person's head, though the head (probably that of Pulenas, the nobleman whose sarcophagus it is) no longer survives in the relief due to an accident of preservation. Years later, in theColosseum, a Charun-like figure calledDispaterwould hit the loser with a hammer to make sure he was dead, perhaps in reflection of Charun.The hammer might also be used to protect the dead; it is sometimes swung at serpents attacking the deceased (as shown on the Orvieto amphora). Most often it is simply held, or the handle planted on the ground and the mallet head leaned upon(above).De Grummond notes that the ferry of Charon appears only once in surviving Etruscan art, and that some Etruscan demons are equipped with oars, but they typically use them as weapons rather than in their maritime function.

Modern views


## Modern views


Many authors tend to take a more sensationalist view of Charun, speaking of him as a "death-demon". Such authors may be inspired by Christian views ofHelland moral punishment. For the Etruscans, as with the Greeks, Hades was merely a morally neutral place of the dead. Neither the "good" nor the "bad" could escape the clutches of death, and both were assembled there together.

Ron Terpening, a professor of Italian literature at theUniversity of Arizona, cites Franz de Ruyt, who claims Charun is similar toChaldeandemons or theHindudivinitiesShivaandKali.He is presumed to be the servant ofMantusandMania, and, like Charon, is comparable to the Greeks'Thanatos, theErinyes, and theKeres.The author, like de Grummond, feels that some laterRenaissancepaintings of GreekCharonmay show the continuity of pre-Christian Etruscan beliefs.Later on when the deity had evolved into the GreekCharon,orCarontein Italian,Terpening notes that Charun's hammer ormalletis sometimes replaced with anoar, although it does not fit with his duties.

According to Jeff Rovin[who?], Charun guided souls on horseback to the underworld and "brings horses to the newly-dead". He also claims that Charun appears to love violence and participates in warfare adding that Charun enjoys natural disasters as well.An Etruscankraterfrom François Tomb(above)depicts Charun withAjaxorAchilles(left, cropped out)slaughteringTrojanprisoners.  This urn is currently held inCabinet des Médailles920,Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris. Rovin says that some accounts depict him with asword, and that he "slices" souls with it. At least one image shows him guiding a soul on horseback, equipped with both a hammer and a sword, though he is simply carrying it on his person.

The Charon ofVergilin theAeneidis particularly cruel; according to W.F. Jackson Knight,"Vergil's Charon is not only the Greek ferryman ofAristophanes[inThe Frogs], but more than half his Etruscan self, Charun, the Etruscan torturing death-devil, no ferryman at all."

Assistants


## Assistants


Charun is believed to have worked with many assistants in the Underworld, although they could be independent deities in their own right.  Most of their names are lost to us, but at least one,Tuchulcha, is identified in theTomb of Orcus II, and has hair and wings like aGorgon.  Tuchulcha, whose gender is debated among scholars, appears in a depiction of the story ofTheseus(known to the Etruscans as "These") visiting the underworld. These and his friendPeirithousare playing aboard game, attended by Tuchulcha.

There are four Charuns shown in a fresco in the Tomb of the Charuns, and each appear to have sub-names. These areCharun Chunchules, the heavily blisteredCharun Huths,Charun Lufe, and the fourth has crumbled away to illegibility.On Laris Pulena's sarcophagus, there are also two Charuns and twoVanthson either side of the figure in the center who is presumably Laris Pulena himself. De Grummond does not cite these figures as assistants, but believes Charun may be a type of creature rather than a singulardemon.

Many of Charun's other presumed assistants appear in the Tomb of the Blue Demons, which is also the home of the only Etruscan rendering of the aforementioned ferry of Charon.

Popular culture


## Popular culture


In contemporary times, Charun has never been as popular as his Greek counterpart, though there have been some occurrences.

He appears in the poem "Back Matter" byRachel Blau DuPlessis, invoking the imagery of the Tomb of the Charuns.Charun isMonster in My Pocket#97.  Unlike Ancient depictions, he is bald, bulky, appears to be wearing no clothing, and his wings look leathery (perhaps in reference to Rovin's claim of "leathery skin") and lack feathers.[5]A brief reference to Charun inThe Tribune's Curse:SPQR VIIa 2003 novel byJohn Maddox Robertsin an invocation to "Father Dis" and related figures, including "Charun of the hammer" (p. 65).Charun is referred to in the song "The one who will not be named" by the metal bandGWAR
