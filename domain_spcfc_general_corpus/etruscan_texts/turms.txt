# Turms

InEtruscan religion,Turms(usually written as 𐌕𐌖𐌓𐌌𐌑Turmśin theEtruscan alphabet) was the equivalent of RomanMercuryand GreekHermes, both gods of 
trade and the messenger god between people and gods.He was depicted with the same distinctive attributes as Hermes and Mercury: acaduceus, apetasos(often winged), and/or winged sandals.He is portrayed as a messenger of the gods, particularlyTinia(Jupiter),although he is also thought to be ‘at the service’ (ministerium) of other deities.

Etruscan artwork often depicts Turms in his role aspsychopomp, conducting the soul into the afterlife.In this capacity he is sometimes shown on Etruscan sarcophagi—in one case side by side withCharunandCerberus.In another depiction, in which the god is labelled as 𐌕𐌖𐌓𐌌𐌑 𐌀𐌉𐌕𐌀𐌑Turmś Aitaśor ‘Turms ofHades’, he brings the shade ofTiresiasto consult withOdysseusin the underworld.Turms also appears in images depicting theJudgement of Paris,as well as in scenes withHercle(Heracles) orPerseus.

The nameTurmsis of distinctivelyEtruscanorigin, like that ofFuflunsbut in contrast to deities such as Hercle andApulu(Apollo), whose names were borrowed fromGreek.

Turms is known more from decoration on everyday objects, such as mirrors, than from cult images,although one dedication has been taken to indicate the existence of a temple of Turms atCortona.

Bernard Combet-Farnoux interprets comments byServiusandMacrobiusas indicating that “Hermes-Turms” had theepithetCamillus, meaning ‘servant’ (i.e. of the other deities).AscholiumonCallimachusadds that “Cadmilosis Hermes inTyrrhenia”; Combet-Farnoux considers Camillus and Cadmilos to be variants of the same name.

Turms is also the name of a character in a historical novel byMika Waltari,The Etruscan, which takes place during the end ofEtruscan civilization.
