# Menrva

Menrva(also spelledMenervaorMenfra) was anEtruscan goddessof war, art, wisdom, and medicine. She contributed much of her character to theRomanMinerva. She was the child ofUniandTinia.

Although Menrva was seen by Hellenized Etruscans as their counterpart toGreekAthena,Menrva has some unique traits that make it clear that she was not an import from Greece. Etruscan artists under the influence of Greek culture, however, liked to portray Menrva withGorgoneion, helmet, spear, and shield, and, on one mirrorback, as bursting from the head of her father, Tinia.Also, she commonly is seen as the protector ofHercle(Heracles) andPherse(Perseus).On a bronze mirror found atPraeneste, she attends Perseus, who consults twoGraeae,and, on another, holds high the head ofMedusa, while she and seated Perseus andHermesall gaze safely at its reflection in a pool at their feet.These images are more likely to reflect literary sources than anycult practice.On a bronze mirror fromBolsena,c.300 BCE, she is portrayed attending a scene of Prometheus Unbound withEsplace (Asclepius), who bandages Prometheus' chest.

Often, Menrva is depicted in a more essentially Etruscan style, as a lightning thrower.Martianusmentions her as one of nine Etruscan lightning deities. Etruscan style works often depict Menrva with a thunderbolt; the thunderbolt imagery seems to be unique to Etruscan Menrva images.

Menrva seems to have been associated with weather phenomena. The Greeks never attributed an association with weather to Athena,making this another important difference between the two religious cults that demonstrates their separate characteristics.

Menrva's name is indigenous to Italy and might even be of Etruscan origin, stemming from an Italic moon goddess,*Meneswā'She who measures'.It is thought that the Etruscans adopted the inherited Old Latin name,*Menerwā, thereby calling her Menrva. However, this has been disputed.Carl Becker suggests that her name appears to contain thePIEroot*men-, which he notes was linked in Greek primarily to memory words (cf. Greek "mnestis"/μνῆστις 'memory, remembrance, recollection'), but which more generally referred to 'mind' in most Indo-European languages.

Menrva was part of atriple deitywith Uni and Tinia, later reflected in the RomanCapitoline TriadofJuno,Jupiter, andMinerva.
