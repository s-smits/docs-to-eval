# Daily life of the Etruscans

Daily life among theEtruscansis difficult to trace, as few literary testimonies are available and Etruscan historiography was highly controversial in the 19th century (seeEtruscology).

Most of our knowledge of the habits and customs of Etruscan daily life is available through detailed observation of the funerary furnishings in their family tombs: decorated urns and sarcophagi, accompanied by everyday objects for both men and women, details of frescoes andbas-reliefs, most of which were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the scientific study of their civilization really began.

Posidonios, a Greek historian, described the richness of the Etruscan table: "Twice a day, the Etruscans prepared a sumptuous table with all the amenities of a fine life; arranged tablecloths embroidered with flowers; covered the table with a large quantity of silver crockery; had a considerable number of slaves serve them".This points to the life of wealthy men, quite different from that of the common people.

The abundant forests of the Etruscan territory enabled the construction of a maritime fleet, as well as mineral exploitation. The prosperity of its trade was based on the export of crafts (bucchero), large quantities of wine and the import of tin fromGaul. From at least the 6th century BC,vine cultivation and wine production have been documented in the region, as evidenced by the manufacture ofamphoraefor transporting wine, which were widely distributed in theTyrrhenianand Mediterranean seas.

Etruscan's diet


## Etruscan's diet


The Etruscans' basic dietconsisted mainly of cereal porridge and vegetables. Salt and freshwater fish were certainly part of the diet. Meat consumption was linked to ritual sacrifices and eaten on religious feast days. Thehare, depicted on vases in hunting scenes, was a highly prized game animal. Many kitchen utensils, colanders,amphorae, vases, bronze ladles and typical fish plates are on display in European museums, including theAltes Museum, theLouvreand theNational Etruscan MuseumatVilla Giulia.

Testaroliis anancientpasta that originated from the Etruscan civilization. The bookRustico: Regional Italian Country Cookingstates that testaroli is "a direct descendant of the porridges of theNeolithic agethat were poured over hot stones to cook". According to an article published byThe Wall Street Journal, it is "the earliest recorded pasta".

Etruscan games, also depicted in tomb frescoes, were an important part of their lives.Herodotusrecounts their many games: dice,kottabos, ball (episkyrosorharpastum),Phersu,Askôliasmos, andborsa.

The Etruscans drew direct inspiration from Greek practices for their pan-Etruscan sports games (Volsinies), pugilism and wrestling, throwing the discus, javelin, long jump, simple foot race or running with weapons (hoplitodromia). Someludi circenses(games), which later the Romans partly took up, were different, such as mounted horse racing (bas-reliefs inPoggio Civitate), acrobatics bydesultores, chariot racing (biga,trigaandquadriga), which theauriga(slaves)practised with the reins tied behind their backs.

The Romans also took up other games known asludi scaenici, ritual and votive stage games,dance or ballet performances (including the histrionics),whichVarrotells uswere performed by an Etruscan tragedy writer calledVolnius, for a genuinely theatrical purpose.

The frescoes depict dancers, and musicians playing various instruments. This practice is also present on the many Hellenistic-inspired vases.

Etruscan divinationwas used to guide decision-making, and the remains of various buildings reveal the practice (thetemplumfor theEtruscan temple) or the superstitions and beliefs that accompanied it (acroterialstatues such as the "cowboy of Murlo").

Etruscan mythology, adapted from that of theGreeks, accompanied every gesture of daily life, including the home (LaresandPenatesgods), farming, warfare and town-building (protective genius).
