# Catha (mythology)

Catha(Etruscan:𐌀𐌈𐌀𐌂,romanized:Catha, also written𐌈𐌀𐌂,Cath,𐌀𐌈𐌖𐌀𐌂,Cautha, or𐌀𐌈𐌅𐌀𐌊,Kavtha) is a femaleEtruscanlunar or solar deity, who may also be connected to childbirth, and has a connection to the underworld.Catha is also the goddess of the south sanctuary atPyrgi, Italy.

She is known asLeucotheain ancient Greek. She is often seen with the Etruscan godŚuriwith whom she shares a cult.Catha is also frequently paired with the Etruscan godFufluns, who is the counterpart to the Greek godDionysus, and Pacha, the counterpart to the Roman god Bacchus.Additionally, at Pyrgi, Catha is linked with the god Aplu, the counterpart to the Greek godApollo.Aplu may have even taken some of the characteristics of Catha when he was brought into theEtruscan religion.Giovanni Colonnahas suggested that Catha is linked to the GreekPersephonesince he links Catha's consort,Śuri, toDis Paterin Roman mythology.

Inscriptions


## Inscriptions


The bulk of information regarding Catha comes mostly from inscriptions on Etruscan artifacts. One example that shows the importance of Catha at Pyrgi is the discovery of gold earrings dating from 530 to 520 BCE which were dedicated to Catha.The Sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas from the third century BCE fromTarquiniahas an epitaph stating that the deceased individual was a priest of Catha amongst many other titles.Catha is named on thePiacenza Liveron the right lobe where the gods of the lights and heavens are listed.This suggests that Catha was a cult deity. On some inscriptions, Catha is simply referred to as "daughter", and in Martianus Capella she is referred to as "the Daughter of the Sun".She has also been called the "Eye of the Sun".This evidence, along with her placement on the Piacenza Liver over Usil, suggests that she may be the counterpart to the Roman Solis Filia; however Solis Filia does not have the underworld connection that Catha does.Catha's underworld connections can be best seen on an Attic skyphos from a necropolis in San Cerbone dating to the 5th century BCE with an inscription stating it is dedicated to Catha.

Cautha-sis also the first deity mentioned in theLead Plaque of Magliano, the full first line reading:

For Cautha, the annually appointed village priest will dedicate 80ez.In addition, dedications must be made in the place of offering, at the stream Casthia, where it empties into the lake, during Hev- period annually. And a dedication must be made in the sacred alcove that is the memorial for the deceased of the Murina family."

Although there are no known labeled images of Catha,Nancy de Grummondhas argued that there are a number of depictions of Catha in art. She has stated that there are several kraters that show a deity that could be identified as Catha.One example that she cites is a krater fromAscianofrom 350-300 BCE that shows a deity beside two horses instead of four; a sign that they are there to take the dead to the afterlife, and this coupled with the other imagery on the krater suggests that this has an underworld aspect which Catha is associated with.Another potential image of Catha is a figure on an antefix on the twenty-celled building on Pyrgi who is again depicted with two horses.This claim is supported by the fact that this antefix is paired with another antefix that depicts a solar divinity who is likelyŚuri, the consort of Catha.A terracotta head discovered at Pyrgi from the fourth century BCE could also potentially a representation of Catha since she was a highly important goddess in the city.

Nancy de Grummondhas also argued that Catha could be a lunar divinity as opposed to a solar divinity. She points out that just because Catha is called the "Daughter of the Sun" does not necessarily mean that she is a solar goddess becauseSelene, the moon goddess in Greek mythology, is sometimes referred to as the daughter of the Sun as well.Some kraters that potentially illustrate Catha show the deity as having an ambiguous gender which is consistent with Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythologies.Lunaand Selene of Roman and Greek mythology, respectively, are shown driving two-horse chariots often in art.De Grummond has also suggested that sinceŚuriis a solar god and his consort is Catha, it would make logical sense for his partner to be lunar as opposed to another solar divinity.
