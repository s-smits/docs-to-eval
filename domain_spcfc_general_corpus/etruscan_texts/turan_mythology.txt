Turan was commonly associated with birds such as thedove,gooseand above all theswan,Tusna, "the swan of Turan".Herretinuewere calledLasas. Turan may be quite ancient but does not appear on the Piacenza list nor inMartianuslist of Etruscan deities. The Etruscan month of July was named after her, although we only know the Latin word for it,Traneus.

Turan was seen as the equivalent tothe RomanVenusand theGreekAphrodite. Her name is the pre-Hellenic root of "Turannos" (absolute ruler, seetyrant),so Turan can be viewed as â€œMistress".

Turan had a sanctuary in the Greek-influencedGravisca, the port forTarquinia, wherevotive giftsinscribed with her name have been found. One inscription calls herTuran ati, "Mother Turan" which has been interpreted as connecting her toVenus Genetrix, Venus the mother ofAeneasand progenitor of theJulio-Claudianlineage.

Turan is one of the few Etruscan goddesses who has survived into Italian folklore fromRomagna. Called "Turanna", she is said to be a fairy, a spirit of love and happiness, who helps lovers.
