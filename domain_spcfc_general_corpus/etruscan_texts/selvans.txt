InEtruscan mythology and religion,Selvansis god of the woodlands and boundaries, including sacred boundaries.He is possibly cognate withRomanSilvanus. As the god of boundaries, he is known by the epithettulariasas stated by a dedication of a statue to the god.His name is 10th on the list of 16 gods on the outer rim of thePiacenza Liver(abronzemodel of asheep’sliverused as a reference or teaching tool fordivination).Votive inscriptions from the liver show that he was a popular god in Etruria.

Only one certain representation of Selvans has been found, alongside a statue ofCulśanś. He is portrayed as a naked youth wearing a cap made of a bear’s hide and high boots.This contrasts from the RomanSilvanus, who is usually shown as a bearded man.
