# Women in Etruscan society

Women were respected inEtruscan societycompared to theirancient GreekandRoman counterparts. Today only the status of aristocratic women is known because no documentation survives about women in other social classes.

Women's role and image evolved during the millennium of theEtruscanperiod. Affluent women were well-groomed and lived a family life within society, where their role was important both politically and administratively.TanaquilandVelia Spurinna[fr]were among the women who played leading roles in Etruscan politics. In the final phase ofEtruscan history, women lost much of their independence amidst conquest by theRoman Republic, and their status became that of Roman women.

Women and Etruscan society


## Women and Etruscan society


Etruscan women were politically important, and dominant in family and social life. Their status inEtruscan civilizationdiffered from their Greek and the Roman peers, who were considered to be marginal and secondary in relation to men.

Ancient writers likeLivyandPliny the Elderattest to the influence of women such asTanaquilandVelia Spurinna[fr].Livydescribes the decisive role played by Tanaquil, the wife ofLucius Tarquinius Priscus. She predicted her husband's success and protected Roman royalty after his assassination.At the beginning of the first century,Claudiustook as his first wifePlautia Urgulanilla, anEtruscan.Pliny refers to Tanaquil as a model of womanly virtue.

Contemporary images of Etruscan women often show them wearing rich attire.Archaeological pieces found in the tombs, such asfrescoes,sarcophagi, urns, and funerary possessions testify to the importance of women in society.Thespindle whorlandspring scalediscovered in the tombs of Etruscan women show that they also practiced manual work, such asspinningandweaving.They participated in banquets, physical exercises, and attended games in which naked athletes participated; and generally could enjoy public life without being stigmatized by men.On occasion, women presided over events from a privileged platform, as shown on the fresco of Orvieto or the plaque ofMurlo. In addition they could own property under their name, manage their homes, and conduct trade.On the frescoes of theTomba delle Bighe[es], noble men and women mingle in the samebleachers.

On funerary urns and on the lids of sarcophagi, they appear as they were in daily life, without retouching, their faces often marked by wrinkles and their bodies showing aging, testifying to a strong character.This type of representation is practically unique in the ancient world, where women were limited to their role as wives, mothers orconcubines.[unreliable source?]

EtruscologistJacques Heurgonquotes the anecdote reported by Livy of a woman who despises her sister because "she lacksmuliebris audacia", that is to say, the energy and ambition that seem characteristic of Etruscan women.Sybille Haynesstudied small bronze sculptures, the oldest of which shows women and men lying in atriclinium, raising the drinking cup; but in the most recent examples, they are sitting next to the husband lying down. Between the two series, theRomanschanged the status of women in the Etruscan society throughRomanization.

The evolution of women's status by period


## The evolution of women's status by period


The characteristics of Etruscan women depended on their social rank, the place where they lived, and the period concerned. The Etruscan world cannot be considered as a homogeneous whole from the social, political, and economic points of view. It is nevertheless possible to highlight in general terms the main characteristics by examining the information and clues that have emerged during archaeological research, comparing them whenever possible with ancient texts.

Villanovan period


### Villanovan period


During theVillanovan period(9th – 8th century BC), parity between men and women seems to have been the rule. The unity of burials between the unmarried couple is evidenced by burialtrousseauxof the period, shows no class differences or dominant personalities or families. The presence of characteristic status symbols, such as weapons for men andspindle whorls, weights, mirrors, and crockery for women, seems to indicate a clear separation of the fields of competence attributed to the two sexes, the status of warrior-farmer for men and the organization of the home for women.

However, even in burials of this early period, exceptions have been identified: some burials have both types of characteristic status symbols or neither. Therefore, the original belief that Villanovan Etruscan women were weavers while Villanovan Etruscan men were warriors may not be entirely true.

Orientalizing period


### Orientalizing period


During the Orientalizing period (approximately 750 to 500 BC, definitions differ), wealth was monopolized by a small number of individuals, revealing social differences, with hereditary transmission that does not seem to mark any distinction between the sexes. Women and men were equally wealthy in their burial trousseaux, as demonstrated by the findings of theRegolini-Galassi tombin Cerveteri and tombs 2 and 11 of thenecropolis of Banditella[fr].

Archaic period


### Archaic period


The Archaic period (580 to 480 BC) highlights women's status in marriage, as evidenced by theSarcophagus of the Spouses(530 BC,Museum of Villa Giulia). The frescoes of the tombs of Tarquinia (6th – 5th century BC) confirm the presence of women in social spaces (banquets and sports), which among the Romans and the Greeks were reserved exclusively for men. But their participation and representation in these events do not seem to confirmTheopompus' claim of women's immorality. Indeed, the frescoes that show couples of spouses, highlight strong monogamous couples. The sarcophagi of semi-lying couples of Vulci (fourth century BC) seem to confirm this fact. Nevertheless, women appear in artistic representations onAttic vasesdancing totally naked on an equal footing with men,and tomb frescoes reveal, as in theTomb of the Bulls, daring erotic scenes showing a woman with several partners, or participating in complicated sexual games.

Already in the 7th century BC,Tanaquil, an aristocrat from the city ofTarquinia, was skilled in the art ofdivination, "like all Etruscans". She urged her husband to leaveEtruriaand settle in Rome. On the way, she interpreted a prodigy and assured him that he would rule Rome, which happened after the death ofAncus Marcius. WhenTarquin the Elderwas assassinated, she had her son-in-lawServius Tulliusproclaimed king.Historian Alain Hus deduced from these accounts thatEtrusca disciplina, the art of interpreting divine signs, was the prerogative of aristocratic families among the Etruscans, and that women could exercise it.

Classic period


### Classic period


During the Classical period, Etruscan women began to show signs of high rank and esteem. The sarcophagi of Chiusi, the urns of Volterra and the frescoes in tombs confirm the high position reached by women on the social ladder.

Inonomastics(of proper names), women's civil status in inscriptions was indicated by their first name, absent in the Latin formulation, and then by their surname, which remained their birth name, even after marriage. In the onomastic formula, thematronymicadded to thepatronymicbecame widespread from the 4th century BC onwards, proving the high regard in which the wives' family of origin was held by the Etruscan aristocratic class.

Hellenistic period


### Hellenistic period


Romanizationbegan around 340 BC and lasted until theAugustanperiod, when acculturation led to the disappearance of Etruscan political power, as their cultural traits were assimilated by the Romans. Etruscan women lost many of their privileges, and adopted the status ofRoman women, who probably also assimilated some of the cultural traits of Etruscan women and gave them a strong influence, such as that exercised byLivia(58 BC – 29 AD), the wife of Augustus, several timesregentand advisor to her husband and the most powerful woman in the early Roman Empire.Several women in the imperial family, includingAgrippina the Younger, also exerted political influence.

Women and the family


## Women and the family


During banquets women lay on thetricliniumnext to their husbands, who acknowledged their equal social position in the management of the family patrimony and the upbringing of their children.Together with their fathers, women gave their names to their children (especially among the highest class of society), with funeralepigramsgiving priority to thematronymic; women are also referred to by theirgensnames and with their own first names, affirming their individuality within the family group.Women's proper names frequently engraved on crockery and funerary frescoes include: Ati, Culni, Fasti, Larthia, Ramtha, Tanaquille, Veilia, Velia and Velka. By comparison, in Roman society, women are referred to by a feminized form of theirnomen gentilicium: thus, all the women of the Liviagensare called Livia.

Women's fashion


## Women's fashion


According to the frescoes and tombs of the Etruscans, women wore elaborate jewelry and make-up. They were often dressed in a tunic over which was placed thechiton, a kind of long coat with short sleeves, edged with small geometric motifs such as incised circles and herringbones. Shoes have pointed, raised toes, reminiscent ofHittitemodels. Hair is worn under thetutulus, a round or conical headdress decorated with geometric motifs, or is gathered at the nape of the neck, with curls falling over the shoulders or in braids framing the face.

Women's accessories


## Women's accessories


Archaeological findings in burialtrousseauxin necropolises, as well as fresco depictions, give a fairly accurate idea of the various accessories used by Etruscan women. Feminine adornment consisted of jewelry, braided gold wire pendants adorned with figurines,palmettesand flowers, necklaces, and precious metal earrings and pins. Etruscan women also had a wide range of refined toiletries at their disposal:ivory,alabasterand glass flasks, containers for ointments or perfumed oils,manicureinstruments, engraved mirrors decorated with mythological scenes, featuring a slightly domed reflective surface and a reverse side decorated with incised motifs, bronze storage boxes decorated with engraved scenes, and so on.

Etruscan women viewed by other civilizations


## Etruscan women viewed by other civilizations


Etruscan women attended banquets alongside men, unlike their Greek contemporaries where democracy was a male-only affair. Greek, and later Roman writers therefore gave Etruscan women a scandalous reputation, although this discredit – theEtruscan truphè– more generally concerned the morals of both sexes.

By the Greeks


### By the Greeks


The Etruscan tradition of mixed banqueting was frowned upon by the Greeks, where women lived in the shadows of the home. Greek daughters and wives stayed in their place in the domestic setting, rarely appearing in the community. As direct neighbors of the Etruscans inMagna Graecia(southern Italy), they were familiar with this difference in custom.Theopompus, a Greek historian of the 4th century BC, whom another Roman author,Cornelius Nepos, finds very slanderous,gives a contemptuous description:"Women enjoy all men in complete freedom. In the streets they walk boldly alongside men and dine lying next to them. They have taken great care of their bodies and faces, removing hair from their skin with melted wax and excelling in nudity". "There is no shame," according to Theopompus, "in committing a sexual act in public [...] when they gather with friends, this is what they do: first, when they have finished drinking and are ready for bed and while the torches are still lit, the servants sometimes bringcourtesans, sometimes handsome boys and sometimes their own wives [...] Etruscan women make children not knowing who the father is".

By the Romans


### By the Romans


Roman women were slightly freer than Greek women, but the status of Etruscan women was considered scandalous by the Romans, who often described their behavior aslicentiousand immoral, comparing them to the musicians and prostitutes of Greek or Roman banquets. Titus Livius contrasted the "virtuous Roman mother" to "Etruscan women lying on their banquet beds".
