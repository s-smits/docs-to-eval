Women were respected in
Etruscan society
compared to their
ancient Greek
and
Roman counterparts
. Today only the status of aristocratic women is known because no documentation survives about women in other social classes.
Women's role and image evolved during the millennium of the
Etruscan
period. Affluent women were well-groomed and lived a family life within society, where their role was important both politically and administratively.
Tanaquil
and

Etruscan history
, women lost much of their independence amidst conquest by the
Roman Republic
