TheLiver of Piacenzais anEtruscanartifact found in a field on September 26, 1877, nearGossolengo, in theprovince of Piacenza, Italy, now kept  in the Municipal Museum of Piacenza, in thePalazzo Farnese.

It is a life-sizedbronzemodel of a sheep's liver covered inEtruscaninscriptions (TLE719), measuring 126 × 76 × 60 mm (5 × 3 × 2.4 inches)  and dated to the late 2nd century BC, i.e. a time when the Piacenza region would already have beenLatin-dominated(Piacenza was founded in 218 BC as a Roman garrison town inCisalpine Gaul).

Description and interpretation


## Description and interpretation


The liver is subdivided into sections for the purposes of performingharuspicy(hepatoscopy); the sections are inscribed with names of individualEtruscan deities.

Middle Eastern parallels; anatomical model


### Middle Eastern parallels; anatomical model


The Piacenza liver is a striking conceptual parallel to clay models of sheep's livers known from theAncient Near East, reinforcing the evidence of a  connection (be it bymigrationor merely by cultural contact) between theEtruscansand theAnatoliancultural sphere. A Babylonian clay model of a sheep's liver dated to theMiddle Bronze Ageis preserved in the British Museum.The Piacenza liver parallels theBabylonianartifact by representing the major anatomical features of the liver (thegall bladder,caudate lobeandposterior vena cava) as sculpted protrusions.

Thetheonymsare abbreviated and in many cases, the reading even of the abbreviation is disputed. As a result, there is a consensus for the interpretation of individual names only in a small number of cases. The reading given below is that of Morandi (1991) unless otherwise indicated:
