# Corrected Agentic Evaluation Flow

## üéØ PROPER AGENTIC EVALUATION PATTERN

The agentic evaluation system now follows the correct pattern for unbiased LLM assessment:

### Phase 1: Ground Truth Generation (With Context)
**Purpose**: Create high-quality questions with definitive answers
**Process**: 
1. LLM analyzes the corpus text
2. Generates questions that test key concepts
3. Provides **ground truth answers** based on corpus content
4. Questions are designed to be answerable independently

**Key Improvements**:
- Questions must be standalone (answerable without corpus)
- Answers are definitive ground truth references
- Added `verification_type` field for better validation
- Focus on objective, verifiable answers

```json
{
  "question": "What year was the Etruscan civilization founded?",
  "answer": "8th century BCE",
  "concept": "Etruscan chronology",
  "difficulty": "basic",
  "verification_type": "factual"
}
```

### Phase 2: Blind Evaluation (WITHOUT Context)
**Purpose**: Test LLM knowledge without giving it access to answers
**Process**:
1. LLM receives ONLY the question
2. NO access to expected answer or corpus context
3. LLM generates response based on its knowledge
4. Response is captured as the "prediction"

**Critical Changes**:
```python
# OLD (FLAWED) - LLM had access to context
evaluation_prompt = f"""Context: {question['context']}
Based on the context above, please answer: {question['question']}"""

# NEW (CORRECT) - Blind evaluation
evaluation_prompt = f"""Please answer the following question based on your knowledge:

Question: {question['question']}

Instructions:
- Provide a direct, concise answer
- Do not use external context or hints
Your answer:"""
```

### Phase 3: Verification & Scoring
**Purpose**: Compare LLM prediction against ground truth
**Process**:
1. Use ground truth answer from Phase 1
2. Compare with LLM prediction from Phase 2
3. Apply appropriate verification method based on `verification_type`
4. Generate objective score

## üîÑ COMPLETE WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

### Input Corpus:
```
"The Etruscan civilization flourished in central Italy from the 8th century BCE 
to the 3rd century BCE. They were known for their advanced metallurgy, creating 
bronze artifacts and tools."
```

### Phase 1 Output (Question Generation):
```json
{
  "question": "What century did Etruscan civilization begin?",
  "answer": "8th century BCE",
  "concept": "Etruscan chronology",
  "verification_type": "exact"
}
```

### Phase 2 Output (Blind Evaluation):
```
LLM Prediction: "The Etruscan civilization began in the 8th century BCE"
```

### Phase 3 Output (Verification):
```json
{
  "ground_truth": "8th century BCE",
  "prediction": "The Etruscan civilization began in the 8th century BCE",
  "score": 1.0,
  "method": "exact_match",
  "details": {"normalized_match": true}
}
```

## ‚úÖ WHY THIS IS CORRECT

### Unbiased Testing
- LLM cannot "cheat" by seeing the expected answer
- Tests actual knowledge vs. corpus memorization
- Mimics real-world evaluation scenarios

### Objective Scoring
- Ground truth is established independently
- Consistent reference point for all evaluations
- Reproducible results

### Realistic Assessment
- Questions test practical knowledge application
- LLM must demonstrate understanding, not copying
- Reveals true capability gaps

## üö® PREVIOUS FLAWS FIXED

### ‚ùå Old Broken Pattern:
1. LLM generates question + answer (with corpus)
2. Same LLM answers the question (with corpus again!)
3. Compares LLM answer to its own generated answer
4. **Result**: Circular validation, inflated scores

### ‚úÖ New Correct Pattern:
1. LLM generates question + ground truth (with corpus)
2. **Different evaluation** - LLM answers without context
3. Compares blind LLM response to established ground truth
4. **Result**: Genuine evaluation of LLM capabilities

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

- ‚úÖ **Memory leak fixed** - Evaluation storage now bounded
- ‚úÖ **File upload security** - Validation and sanitization added
- ‚úÖ **Agentic flow corrected** - Proper blind evaluation
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** - Comprehensive request validation
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate code removed** - Streamlined verification logic

The system now performs genuine agentic evaluation that accurately measures LLM performance against objective benchmarks.
