# Complexity-Aware Agentic Evaluation System

## üéØ ENHANCED 4-PHASE WORKFLOW WITH COMPLEXITY FILTERING

The system now includes **complexity assessment** to ensure questions actually challenge modern LLMs, preventing evaluation against trivial questions.

### üìä DIFFICULTY PREDICTION & TARGETING

#### Expected LLM Performance on Different Question Types:
- **Simple Facts**: "What year did X happen?" ‚Üí **95%+ accuracy** ‚ùå **TOO EASY**
- **Basic Math**: "What is 25% of 200?" ‚Üí **98%+ accuracy** ‚ùå **TOO EASY**
- **Dictionary Definitions**: "What is concept Y?" ‚Üí **90%+ accuracy** ‚ùå **TOO EASY**
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: "How do A and B interact to produce C?" ‚Üí **70-85% accuracy** ‚úÖ **GOOD**
- **Complex Analysis**: "What are implications of X given Y and Z?" ‚Üí **60-75% accuracy** ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**

#### Target: Create questions that challenge GPT-4, Claude-3.5, Gemini-1.5 Pro

## üîÑ ENHANCED WORKFLOW PHASES

### Phase 1: Challenging Question Generation
**Enhanced Prompt Focus**:
```
‚ùå AVOID: "What year did X happen?" (too easy - basic fact lookup)
‚ùå AVOID: "What is 2+2?" (too easy - trivial math)  
‚ùå AVOID: "Define concept Y" (too easy - dictionary lookup)

‚úÖ CREATE: "How do concepts A and B interact to produce outcome C?"
‚úÖ CREATE: "What are the implications of X given constraints Y and Z?"
‚úÖ CREATE: "Why would approach A be preferred over B in situation C?"
```

**Question Types Emphasized**:
- Analytical reasoning (2-3 logical steps)
- Synthesis combining multiple concepts
- Comparative analysis between approaches
- Implication/consequence questions
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Multi-layered conceptual relationships

### Phase 2: Dual Verification (Correctness + Complexity)
**Enhanced Verification Process**:
```json
{
  "is_correct": true/false,
  "verified_answer": "corrected answer if needed",  
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "complexity": 0.0-1.0,  // ‚≠ê NEW
  "reasoning": "correctness explanation",
  "evidence": "specific quote from corpus",
  "complexity_analysis": "why easy/medium/hard for modern LLMs"  // ‚≠ê NEW
}
```

**Complexity Scoring (0.0-1.0)**:
- **0.0-0.3**: TOO EASY - Automatically rejected regardless of correctness
- **0.4-0.6**: MODERATE - Requires reasoning, domain knowledge
- **0.7-1.0**: CHALLENGING - Complex reasoning, synthesis, analysis

### Phase 3: Blind LLM Evaluation
**Unchanged** - LLM still answers without corpus or expected answer

### Phase 4: Performance Scoring  
**Enhanced with complexity metadata** for analysis

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Automatic Easy Question Filtering:
```python
# CRITICAL: Reject questions that are too easy for modern LLMs
if complexity < 0.4:
    is_correct = False  # Override - reject easy questions regardless of correctness
```

### Enhanced Logging:
```
‚úÖ Verified Q1 (complexity: 0.72): How do Etruscan burial practices reflect...
‚ùå Rejected Q2: TOO EASY (complexity: 0.15) - Simple year lookup
‚úÖ Verified Q3 (complexity: 0.68): What implications would the decline of...
```

### Complexity Statistics Tracking:
```
Ground truth verification: 6/10 questions verified (40.0% rejected)
Complexity distribution: Avg complexity: 0.65 | Easy: 0 | Moderate: 4 | Hard: 2
```

## üìà EXPECTED IMPACT ON EVALUATION QUALITY

### Before Complexity Filtering:
- 60-70% of questions would be trivial for modern LLMs
- High overall scores (85-95%) due to easy questions
- Poor discrimination between different LLM capabilities
- Benchmark becomes obsolete quickly as LLMs improve

### After Complexity Filtering:
- Only challenging questions (complexity ‚â• 0.4) are included
- More realistic scores (60-80%) that reflect actual capabilities  
- Better discrimination between strong and weak LLMs
- Benchmark remains relevant as LLMs advance

## üéØ EXAMPLE QUESTION TRANSFORMATIONS

### ‚ùå OLD (Too Easy):
```
Q: "What century did the Etruscan civilization begin?"
A: "8th century BCE"
Complexity: 0.2 ‚Üí REJECTED
Expected LLM Accuracy: 90%+
```

### ‚úÖ NEW (Appropriately Challenging):
```
Q: "How did the geographic constraints of central Italy influence the development of Etruscan political structures compared to contemporary Greek city-states?"
A: "The mountainous terrain and limited arable land led to smaller, more decentralized city-states (lucumonies) focused on trade networks rather than territorial expansion, unlike Greek poleis which could leverage coastal access for maritime dominance."
Complexity: 0.78 ‚Üí ACCEPTED
Expected LLM Accuracy: 65-75%
```

## üìä COMPLEXITY DISTRIBUTION TARGETS

**Optimal Benchmark Composition**:
- **0% Easy questions** (0.0-0.3) - Automatically filtered out
- **60% Moderate questions** (0.4-0.6) - Core evaluation content
- **40% Hard questions** (0.7-1.0) - Discrimination at high performance

**Quality Metrics**:
- Average complexity: 0.55-0.70 (challenging but fair)
- Rejection rate: 20-40% (shows quality control is working)
- LLM success rate: 60-80% (indicates appropriate difficulty)
