# Ancient Egyptian Mathematics

Ancient Egyptian mathematics was a sophisticated system that developed over millennia. The Egyptians made significant contributions to geometry, arithmetic, and algebraic thinking.

## Number System

The Egyptian number system was decimal-based but used hieroglyphic symbols. They had symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on. This system allowed them to perform complex calculations for architectural and administrative purposes.

Mathematical papyrus documents like the Rhind Papyrus and the Moscow Papyrus provide insight into their mathematical thinking. These documents contain problems involving fractions, geometry, and practical applications.

## Geometric Achievements  

Egyptian geometry was primarily practical, developed for construction and land surveying. They understood concepts like the 3-4-5 triangle for creating right angles, which was essential for pyramid construction.

The Great Pyramid of Giza demonstrates their geometric precision. Its base is nearly perfectly square, and its angles are calculated with remarkable accuracy. This required sophisticated understanding of proportions and measurements.

## Arithmetic Operations

Egyptian arithmetic used a doubling method for multiplication. To multiply by 7, they would calculate 1x, 2x, 4x, then add the appropriate combinations. This method, while different from modern techniques, was highly effective.

Division was performed through the reverse process. They would find combinations of doubles that reached the desired quotient. This system worked well for their decimal-based number system.

## Fractional Mathematics

Egyptians had a unique approach to fractions, primarily using unit fractions (fractions with numerator 1). The Eye of Horus fractions were used for measuring grain and represented powers of 1/2.

Complex fractions were expressed as sums of unit fractions. This approach, while cumbersome by modern standards, allowed for precise calculations in trade and construction projects.

## Legacy and Influence

Egyptian mathematical knowledge influenced Greek mathematics and, through them, the broader mathematical tradition. Concepts of geometry and arithmetic that originated in Egypt continued to develop throughout antiquity.

The practical focus of Egyptian mathematics demonstrates how mathematical thinking emerges from real-world needs. Their achievements in construction and administration required sophisticated mathematical tools and concepts.
